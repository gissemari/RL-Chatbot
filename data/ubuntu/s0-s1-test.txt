hi, i've signed for receiving some nice pressed cd's :) But what architecture are they going to be (x86?)
i386
is it possible to get some ppc ones too ?
it varies - we got the xserve g5s that serve as the Ubuntu powerpc buildds to work with ppc32 with a relatively small kernel patch
don't know the exact issues, but a 64 bit kernel (gentoo live cd) boots
it's usually possible to backport the changes from what I can tell. Most of the new machine support happens in the ppc64 branch first, though.
nice.. But my friend isn't die-hard enough to do that :)
when I did it I didn't have much choice; it was that, or Warty would've had no powerpc support at all
sounds like its gonna be a good ... go,hopefullty its not impossible to install like debian :D,debian just sucks, I have never used it cause I just cant get it to install,its impossible, and I have been on a linux box for 9 years,even gentoo is easier than debian...
What are you talking about?
debian being impossible to install,maybe I am just stupid


But both Woody and the D-I especially are but really chicken feat aren't they? ;0
?,Well, use testing then...
I have SID/SCUD installs running on 2 boxes here...testing isn't it actually more Experimental than experimental is at times? ;)
Hehe.,discover is like kudzu.,discover and hotplug covers different part.
ah pardon me ignorance :|


supposedly firefox 1.0 will download flash automatically,that's what I heard anyways,if firefox 1.0 fetches it automatically, that would theoretically take care of the issue for most ubuntu users...
Not for PPC users I guess?
well, they were kind of screwed anyways, no?
Macromedia doesn't care. Period.,You mean 2.6.,Actually "apt-get install hal" and dbus/hal is in Debian (Sid).
I'm not saying that I couldn't have installed dbus/hal (I use Gentoo).  I'm just saying that I had no reason to yet, so this is my first experience with it.
Ah, okay. :-),Sid rebuild, I guess.,totem-xine conflicts totem-gstreamer.
you rock,your mono repo made me happy today.
:)
what's it take to convince you to package ifolder? ;),yeah I hate that,ooh, f-spot ... ROCK.
like what
ifolder.
oh, right..,hah i watch dvds on my laptop every night,how do you mean new
bb time to install ;-0,hi all,problems ;(,I installed ubuntu..fine mostly...but X wont start,ie: gdm < not found...same with startx. ?,no I used my cats toy,great just in time lol
did you get any errors during the install?
it tried to access ext3 but I used reiserfs,any ideas there ;(
if you type 'sudo aptitude install ~tDesktop' what happens?.any joy with that command?
yea,no,not replacement,no,hotplug continues to take care of module loading as the system is running,discover only runs on boot,afaik,discover tries a total hardware module loading solution, hotplug tries to be one for dynamic unload/load,discover is useful int he installer
ah,I'm not sure...been hearing of a couple of instances where perfectly working partitions not been detected when installing in"n00b" mode. Tried the D-I out in expert mode at a pal's place, no such "probs" though hmmm
I've always been turned off by the mwilsons that hang out in there, if you know who I'm talkin bout
none here as well from that 1 experience but I did it via expert...so hmmm,hehe ;) ahh he just has his particular brand of twisted humour I think like a few others including Geurin ;)
fetman: =)
!!!,:D,e rikingen hr inne? :)
Don't think so.
:(,jag som skulle be om pngar
You can try to sell a guided tour in your garden.
ehok
Anyway, this is really OT and someone will bug us soon :)
ot? of track?
off topic
so?,:),dom har inte +t hr ;)
OK anyone..still after running aptitude and selecting the desktop > xbase-clients > 'g'..it demands the ubuntu cd which i insert in cdrom drive..it says setting up X..but 'startx' still says no such file or dir from : /usr/bin/X11/X ;(sigh..any idea what next ???
you'd want an X server for that.
yes but doesn't it do that automagic due to dependency checks ?,ok
that shouldn't be the error, that's just that you're not using a font server. other font path entries should work. check your .xsession-errors or something..
do you recall what DIR its in ?..its not here in /etc/X11 and Iflat dont recall damn
home dir,ordinarily, in your home directory.
yeah indeed nm..I found it..I didn't think it was in $HOME but I checked thinking itmight be and voila LOL.ok it says no fonts found ...?
well, you want xfonts-base and probably {75,100}dpi and scalable and perhaps a few more.
alldone except for scalable fonts,I saw that but didn't install it thinkin xbase-fonts was eougfh
dunno what gnome expects, tho.
did I miss something during install..so the install doesn't assume gnome and its components to be installed and ready for startx ? :(


I'm not having much luck with totem here either.
unfortunately, totem can't play very many file formats without patented codecs, which we do not include on the CD,you can install totem-xine from universe for more functionality
I'm having trouble with just MP3s, though, which rhythmbox is handling fine.
hmm,totem plays both mp3 and vorbis OK for me.care to file a bug report?
I get crashes when using the gstreamer backend..Is it possible to have a fully functional flash plugin on ppc?
for it to be truly fully functional, I think it would have to come from macromedia, and I don't think they provide a linux/powerpc plugin,very slick graphical boot process, Depending on your display and on which fonts you use, they can look
I guess I've just happened across a lot of monitors it looks better on ;).  I was just making sure it wasn't simply a mistake that it was disabled.
yes
Thanks.
see above
OK guys trying to 'startx' is giving me: usr/bin/X11/X..no such file or DIR,and I dont recall what package its part of .i'd think xfree86-common?,or base,sudo reboot'ing LOL,wish < luck <G>,ok I am getting one ODD error at boottime..'can not find ext3 FS on hdb3'..hdb3 is where / is which is my 65GB partition for ubuntu..why is is looking for ext3 when I clearly formatted for reiserfs ? <GH>,also im geting 'yenta_socket' failing at boot...FYI...whatever the hell yenta is LOL!!!,OK guys anyone feel free to jump onon this one LOL...just rebooted and I stil  get no such file orDIR on /usr/bin/X11/X :(
yenta is some cardbus (or pcmcia?) stuff
oh no wonder then.I dont have a laptop here  <G>
It might be cardmgr or something loading it.
yeah no prb..at this point its theleast of my worries <G>
xserver-xfree86?,Since you might want to show the apps on a remote xserver :),try marillats debian repository,there's no mplayer in debian because of legal issues
hmm I dont understand that though..mplayer by itself doesn't have to ship with 'those' libraries..mdk and others ship with mplayer its just not able to deal with encrypted DVD's as it were out of the box so I'm shocked debian can't do something similar
It's not that.,Debian does it that way with Xine,.
Anyone else having FireFox stability issues on warty?,My status bar keeps flickering,I don't know. I'm using it now for the second time. I have three tabs open, first the ubuntu wiki, and then two woth mailman subscriptions,I'll restart Firefox and see what happens,hmm.. fine now,hehe.will there be any KDE sources?.Or do I get that from sarge?
KDE is available in universe,we're just fixing up some breakage in there atm,you need to uncomment universe in your sources.list,but give it a little while, we need to fix a couple of things,evolution is a great product, supports groupware functions, etc.,thunderbird is always available in supported for those who want it, though :),gotta weigh up appropriateness for the majority of users, market leadership, etc., etc.,nothing new is being added,currently it's called 'warty-changes' and is hidden,5.10 :-),make sure the address book you care about is chosen for autocompletion.the debugging artwork?
hmmm... I saw it on a gentoo box, I'm sure, I'll ask my friend if it was gdm or something else
what did you see?
congrats for ubuntu!.does ubuntu ships with postfix?
by default!,no, those are from our repositories too,but we only do support for our 'main' ones, not our 'universe' ones,we're not going to sell ubuntu,but we're going to support it, and partner to support it,if you have any suggestions, please mail jeff.waugh@canonical.com :-) thanks!
sorry I lost my scroll history. Is your mail jeff.waugh AT canonical.com ?
which mail?
I've sent you a message about a support partnership in sept 23, I think.
can you resend?,interested in making gnome useful on old hardware, sure, but it's challenging. basically, you just need 256MB RAM or above.
I see. I do not want to start a flamewar here. But does linux/X/gnome miss something to run "fine" in a low end machine, or is it just too "feature-full"? I mean, win98 runs fine here.
gnome (and other desktop components) does a heck of a lot more than win98,there are lots of things that need optimisation - it's just a matter of time,it's more fun working on new stuff than fixing old code :)
hehe.
#ubuntu-pt might help :)
hmm I'm trying to find some other members to #ubuntu-br :)
aha,that's an entirely different matter then :),estou procurando minhas calas!
just curious does the current iso download have gnome 2.8 in it?,cool thanks,lol.a bad one?,ah,and is this distro based on "testing"
based upon unstable, I believe.,Yup.,gnome-ppp or gnome-system-tools
Working for Canonical sounds like it would be fun...
Its a _lot_ of work, but you go to bed at night realizing you did good work. :) 
just curious does the current iso download have gnome 2.8 in it?,cool thanks,lol.a bad one?,ah,and is this distro based on "testing"
no, unstable,http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/relationship/document_view,hmm, it looks like it doesn't mention unstable explicitly on that page; it probably should.  I'll make a note,yes
thanks thats it :)
dell laptop; did you run into the IRQ7 issue? (#1254),I'm trying to figure out how we can make that Just Work.so basically, the Dell BIOS assigns other devices to IRQ7, it seems?.does pci=noacpi help?,yes, there are
i dont see them in there (power.sh)
the 'xset dpms' commands
now the laptop has been sitting unplugged for about 10mins and the screen has not shut off,so the lcd shut off does not seem to be working now
yes, writing an .iso to DVD works out of the box
cool thanks
nolapic is automatically enabled on some Dell laptops already,if you file a bug with dmidecode output, we can add yours to the list
ok..will do
ls -tr
you refering to an install run through?
I pasted an rsync link above,yes, rsync still works if you don't have an iso
you know anything about setting up PATH for java
yes, screem is in warty
I was seeing > 300KBs on the iso torrent yesterday
I was seeing 400+ on it myself,which is insane since the connection at redhat has never cracked 300 for me before
or if the partition flows over, like in my case
some of us are within a short distance of each other, but not working in the same building
thx


out of curiousity does Ubuntu include both hotplug and discover? seems like many are having probs running alsa because the oss stuff gets loaded also altho a simple addition to blacklist, discover.conf can resolve the issue easily...any ideas?
yeah i have that exact problem,every debian based distro, alsa has not worked till i blacklisted the oss drivers
ah?,I just installed ubuntu on my laptop,VERY nice :).can I ask a question?,I did a default install and it detected my centrino wireless adapter.Isn't that a proprietary driver?,except that it didn't ask for a root password :)
no, it's an open source driver developed by Intel,ipw2200.sourceforge.net
ah, ok. thanks


just curious does the current iso download have gnome 2.8 in it?,cool thanks,lol.a bad one?,ah,and is this distro based on "testing",cool thanks,was just there..couldnt find where it said,ah the new debian installer is gettin pretty easy.u guys have the nvidia drivers in there?
they're in "restricted"
sounds about right 
it's not really a function of debian,it's a function of the kernel,it's way simpler than that.but are you sure you wanna do that?,that's a known bug
so does the lid thing just not work?
just a sec
i dont want a full power down...dont even care that much about the backlight(tho it would be nice) I just want the desktop to come back up..all i get is a blank screen with a flashing cursor
okay, try this.work?,try xscreensaver-command -throttle,try xscreensaver-command -throttle && xscreensaver-command -lock
it appears not
try "sudo chvt 1"
ok it took me to prompt, the alt-f7 took me back to X
what kind of video card in that laptop?,alright, do this: "sudo mv /etc/acpi/lid.sh /etc/acpi/lid.sh.bak"
you get my last msg?
okay, it's a problem with your hardware,that should work,be sure to do "mv /etc/acpi/lid.sh.bak /etc/acpi/lid.sh"
whoa..the powerbutton worked that time...wierd,tho it does stop at acpi_power_off called.you fixed them?.so any other thoughts on what i can do?
nope
ah ok..that makes sense..,ok thanks...ill give it a shot


gnome-themes depends on gtk2-engines-smooth, which doesn't have an install candidate
looking into it now
thanks.how long will it take to fix the smooth dep bug?
-5 seconds
cool!
I do, as do many other canonical folk
on an ibook?
no, on a desktop.   jdub uses it on an ibook
pbbuttonsd is being retarded
it's 0700 down there, he's probably not awake yet
I can't set my eject key in GNOME because pbbuttonsd is stealing it
is this the issue where f12 and eject are the same key or something?
do you know how to make a ubuntu kernel image?
yes
do you just use make-kpkg?
yes, you can do it that way
how else can you do it?
may I ask why you need to build a custom kernel?  we like to avoid that for you :-),you can also build the linux-source-2.6.8.1 source package
I like custom kernels... I don't need a bunch of useless modules loading,like, it's loading ehci_hcd and ohci_hcd
and you don't have USB?
I have usb, but I don't need both ehci and ohci loaded
are you sure?
why would I?
I need both ehci_hcd and uhci_hcd loaded in order to support usb 1.1 and 2.0
also, for some reason I can't get the eject key to work... if I hit fn+eject, I get F12, which is correct... but hitting eject gets nothing
it shouldn't need to load those modules, but it happens here as well.  seems like a bug,hmm, I don't have an eject key here, but I think pbbuttonsd is supposed to handle that
hmm... it's mapping eject to meta_r.what does your /etc/sysctl.conf say?
I'll tell you in a moment; need to power on that machine
hrmm... I wonder what keymap you use....what does it mean to have sa use bogofilter by default?
bogofilter is a spam filtering package
and evo on ubuntu uses that instead of sa?
yes
what if sa is installed?
I'm unsure of the status of the implementation; that's why my comment on the bug was phrased as a question :-)
ah, ok.spamassassin is unsupported software?
spamassassin is in universe
Hmmm, I read morphix in that URL. What has Ubuntu to do with morphix? *beingcurious*
our live cd is morphix based, and alex works with us :)
ic, thx.,Fine!,It sounds better from hour to hour. ;-)


okay guys, I have a feature suggestion/request... since ubuntu uses udev, X can't autoload the nvidia driver when it hits char-major-195, so, when setting up the nvidia drivers, one of 2 things must happen: a script must create the nvidia dev nodes, or the module must be loaded with /etc/modules,the nvidia drivers don't properly support sysfs supposedly, so udev can't make the nodes for you
isn't there a hotplug setting in /etc/default/hotplug for PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY?
hrm, didn't check there... lemme look...,ah yes,IGNORE_PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY=true
mine is set to false
did you set it that way manually?
yes
shouldn't have to do that IMO


hi.is ubuntu stable on ppc?
yes
cause i fond nothing about the ppc port


One more question: For which hardware platforms is Ubuntu? Just x86? Haven't found any note on the FAQ, neither on the website no in the wiki.
x86, amd64, ppc
Thx.,Although I hoped for Sparc32. :)
Will it be possible to perpetually upgrade Ubuntu releases, just like one can upgrade Debian 3.0 to 3.1?
what is this universe-thingy?,(I haven't installed ubuntu yet...)
it's everything else from the open source world you might want on warty
ok,thx


getting ati to release the information needed to get suspend working on newer apple laptops would be nice also,license for one
I am not talking about SUN's Java.
well many people build things against it and many of the alternatives aither also have a sucky license or don't implement everything
So help implementing it.
oooh mon cheri *^_^*,just wait until you get to try out the instant apply functions ;).hey can you run gnome-volume-manager?
yup
hmm :/
have you had a problem with shutting down your ibook? mine hangs at "Unmounting local filesystems..."
anyone gotten mplayer and mozilla to work
I compiled mplayer by hand it worked fine,I installed build-essential, then ./configured mplayer with prefix=/usr/local/mplayer; everything compiled and installed without issue, works great
you did compile it with the fakeroot thingy,you did NOT rather compile it with the fakeroot thingy
I took my path of least resistance,actually think the nvidia stuff will show up as a choice in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 after the package is installed
why does ubuntu install gcc-3.4 by default?,ok, wtf is up with epiphany not being able to start
you got epiphany?
apt-get install epiphany-browser,but when it starts up, it tells me it can't find the .server file
oh yeah, it's in universe,not supported. Eugenia also said it fails on startup
why isn't it supported?
I meant, it's not in the main ubuntu distribution
ah, ok,actually, for powerpc, epiphany-browser is in main


ping?
here.can you provide a reference for the issue(s) you're referring to?
sure, wait a few secs...,http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00075.html
ah, it's gnutls7 which has problems security-wise I think,gnutls10 has problems with threads and other normal bugs like thta,that,filed as #1276,looks like it should be easy to free ourselves of gnutls7; only one package in main depends on it
also see #258975, there is some mail from upstream about libgnucrypt7 and libgnutls10...  (but since 6 month release cycle, it should be smaller problem then having it in sarge)


nm I got it,here goes,yeah I could reinstall but the linux leet'er in me wants to 'fix' it LOL!!!!,or should I say the handiman in me wants to 'fix it' <G>,question ...its downloading all of this instead of getting it from the CD...how do I tell aptitude to get from cd instead ? lol
my default apt.sources that ubuntu installed has the cdrom source in it already
mine does too,hm maybe its a flag I messed up in aptitude,possibly...maybe the cd only has a base system then..,seems unlikely though as it was almost 600MB
the list of packages on the CD is easily visible in the .list file near the iso image
if I recall you said your install at end gave you a working desktop..so im guessing then that I had touble due to lag experienced by demand.
yes my install gave me a working desktop; video, network, sound
when did you finish your download.maybe this is what spiv is referring to
download of the iso?,over the weekend
thats not it then likely..it must be demand,okay then when did you do your install
I think saturday,it's been discussed on the mailing list quite a bit, don't know if it's in the faq yet
why is aptitude better than apt-* ? 
it is a higher-level tool, it has an interactive interface, it has some additional features like removing packages which are no longer needed
and it actually works ? :) 
but more importantly, you can play minesweeper.apt-get doesn't work for you?
it does, im just concerned when things remove packages for me :) 
oh, that,it is actually fairly smart.  it records whether you explicitly installed a package, or whether it was installed to satisfy a dependency,if it was installed to satisfy a dependency, and you remove the package which had the dependency, it removes the extra packages as well
okay, ill take your word for it :) 
ubuntu avoids that particular issue by supporting only apache2 :-)
not true, im using ubuntu and i have it trying to install apache1 
not true?
i've had this ubuntu install try install apache1 numerous times :) 
then you must have enabled universe in sources.list :-P,which, as the comments explain, gives you access to unsupported packages
yes, :) 
apt-get install libapache2-mod-php4 if you want php
i've done it already, although i'm rather certain that these things should be and could be more `streamlined` 
agreed; we have some interesting plans in that department
Thats one reason i wanted to ditch Mepis off my second partition, not really a big fan of KDE,And it just seens KDE centric, like most distros these days anyways.,With the exception of Fedora,Excuse my poor english at the moment btw, brb..How stable is this anyways?.Anyone here actually running it as a desktop OS ?,haha, how do you like it.,I wonder how well it will play with my picky hardware.,Sweet,I wish i could only find one distro that fully takes advantage of my hardware.
what do you have that gives you problems?
I could never find one.,Well, i miss being able to use my "fn" shortcuts on my laptop, among other annoyances.,Would be nice if i was able to control brightness settings, vga/lcd, etc.,Its a Sony PIII 800 laptop.
ah, a sony laptop, ouch ;),I don't even know if windows fully supports them, hehe
Screen brightness is always set to high, as a result battery drains much faster.
(I mean, if you do a vanilla windows install),hallo
I am missing suspend / hibernate option on my thinkpad (when using ACPI)...,but that's more kernel then distro issue
mmm, my new lappy needs dsdt upgrades and things - icky
i had to wait for few bios updates and disable screen blanking on T40/p, but now it just works...,I asked before, but nobody responded.  Ubuntu is using libgnutls10, but I thought it suffers from some security design flaw, at least I remember some mail on d-d@l.d.o about it
not sure, mdz would know more details,we decided to ship xpdf for more thorough pdf support, but didn't put gpdf in supported,we'll most likely ship it by default Hoary
gpdf is part of gnome 2.8...  so I was interested why it's not in main...
yeah, that's why :)
I have spare machine with two 36GB discs; do you think that this would be enough to make czech mirror of Ubuntu?
um, from memory, yes
any chance to have ipw2100 and ipw2200 drivers in restricted (intel wireless cards with binary firmware).I am going to investigate Gnome BT Downloader as it is mentioned on Bounties page.  who I may talk about it afterwards?.I am working on GNOME UI BitTorrent Bounty; who I am supposed to contact with result?
sabdfl can help with that :)
ping?
pong
I just finished polishing gnome bittorent downloader, could you please look at it?
will have a look in a while, attempting to relax a bit atm ;)
no problem, I am leaving to do some weekend shopping anyway :-)
a quick search will find that bug
w00t,2.8!,Thats one reason i wanted to ditch Mepis off my second partition, not really a big fan of KDE,And it just seens KDE centric, like most distros these days anyways.,With the exception of Fedora,Excuse my poor english at the moment btw, brb..How stable is this anyways?.Anyone here actually running it as a desktop OS ?,haha, how do you like it.,I wonder how well it will play with my picky hardware.
on all my desktops :),we're working on 'totally rad' laptop support for ubuntu :),lots of which is in warty, some will have to wait for hoary,open computer > desktop preferences > keyboard shortcuts,choose one of them that maps to one of your funny keys, like volume up/down or whatever,and hit the right button,we have great support for most acpi implementations,but some require a bit of kernel work and so on,for instance, my X300 doesn't think it has batteries :)
thats harsh, another reason to use XP
depends on what's important to you, of course. but linux moves faster than any other os on issues like this. we'll get there.,powernowd :),no, it's normal,their own
Humm, I just installed tpb and it fails because there's not /dev/nvram..Perhaps it's related with devfs stuff?
we use udev rather than devfs,but it's possible, yes
Another weird thing, is that my cdrom has been kidnapped by the system.,It's busy now. I had this kind of problems with nautilus on gnome 2.6 a lot of times.
you can fiddle with that in Computer -> Desktop Preferences -> Removable Storage.oh, you mean it won't let you unmount?
Yes.
worst case, pop up a terminal and say 'pumount /dev/cdrom'
pumount /dev/cdrom
all relevant windows closed?
lsof | grep hdc said nothing.,Yes.
might need to run lsof as root,we're not using prelinking, no
So, perhaps it's gnome 2.8 faster.
we do tune all the .debs for Pentium 4,it's *possible* that makes a difference (although I'm a little sceptical)
Perhaps I have more services running on my debian.,I'm using a Pentium III, anyway
yep
OK..What about this one?
I don't know, I'm afraid
Perhaps I have explained it really wrong.
I don't know an awful lot about the desktop, I'm afraid
im not sure how much i like the udev idea :P 
udev is good
heh, and its not been moved to the favoruable device manager in 2.6.* ... im not sure how much i like that ide a:P 
it works fine here always did, and makes my /dev clean
from what i understood it had some `issues` with certain hardware,although that was from a article. ,ill see if i can find it for you 
maybe, but it's worth a try :)
of course :) just not on a production server that cant stand the upgrade downtime for every release :) ,http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/1893


does anyone know then..does the ubuntu install supposed to prompt for a full working gnome desktop??..just wondering cause plopping me down to a console ...startx should have just 'worked'....???
It should've setup gdm by default, in fact.
odd..did your install do it okay then?
Yep, no brainer.  Did your install give any errors or something?  It sounds like it didn't install all the packages or something odd.,Fonts and xscreensaver and so forth should all be pulled in by installing the "ubuntu-desktop" task.
yes near end it errored out but i'm not sure if it couldn;t read from the servers because they were 'busy,although atm i'm further but its like nursing a baby back to health LOL
Just try installing ubuntu-desktop again.
ok,my destkop is up but it stopped after displaing the 'second icon' on bottom of gnome 2.8 logo....all I have now is a blank light blue screen,can you give me please once more that command..I lost it when I left channel earlier
I'm not sure what command you're referring to...
oh ok...well..how do I do it from aptitude then..
Look under "tasks" in aptitude.,There was also a snafu with an uninstallable package in the archive that got fixed a little while ago, so it's possible that was your problem too (if the error was something like "uninstallable dependency gtk2-themes-smooth")
frankly i' m not sure..but yes near end of install I got some error yes,ijust dont recall sadly what it was,likely thats it yes ;-))..thx !!,ic,odd I dunno shrug..m_tt* says he installed saturday and had no problems..so I flat dunno wha happened to me other than I guess lag from demand caused something to get missed
When did you try to install?  In the last few hours?
anyway..desktop install is finshed in aptitude so here goes nottin!,yes indeed
Right, so it's probably the bug I mentioned then.
in the last hour yes...but the other guy installed saturday
Because that happened a few hours ago I belive, and just got fixed.
so I dont see how it would be related,ahhhhhhhhhhh no wonder
Didn't the other guy say that it worked for them? :)
your apps can use alsa directly, if  remember correctly, but if you like sound multiplexing, like 2 sounds at the same time, you have to have esd use alsa
i thought alsa didnt need a multiplexer
i'm using woody and kde. if i get a message on giam while i', listening to a cd, i don't hear the bell in gaim,but when i turn off the music, all of the gaim sounds come in. delayed.
well im not hearing any sound right now,not giam not rb
sorry but my experience was with kde/arts and not gnome/esd.  have you tried the site?  it has a link for sound.
thansk peacemaker885
first things first, you need to have alsa detect ur sound card
alsa detects my sound card i thing,think,it lists my card in the volume control app
make sure that alsa sound server is not muted.  i don't know if its on by default in wart but its muted when you compile it
i checked it doesnt seem muted
hmmnn...
you said there was something about sound on their site?
yes..let me look,heh..sorry but it was 'sounder',not sound
lol,let me check to make sure the plug didnt pop out of the back of the computer
yep, its stuff like that half of the time :)
apparently thats what happened
cool..enjoy
whoops i guess not,:((
i wonder if anyone has gotten sound up? 
sound works when i plugged it into the onboard sound card just not my sb live
maybe there's something about it in the mailing lists..
apparently everything is using oss. and i cant have that
Will it be possible to perpetually upgrade Ubuntu releases, just like one can upgrade Debian 3.0 to 3.1?
yes, we'll support constant upgrades from version to version
Thanks -- very cool.


Will it be possible to perpetually upgrade Ubuntu releases, just like one can upgrade Debian 3.0 to 3.1?
surely possible, but I wonder if it'll be obvious in the interface. it isn't in xandros.
The reason I ask is because in Fedora it's basically not supported to upgrade with apt/yum; they recommend a complete reinstall.


Can I view a list of packages online?  And is there an ftp install option?
single cd install, after that use aptitude or synaptic
I assume apt-get as well?


I downloaded gnoppix and its pretty good.. never really liked the idea of a heavy KDE on a livecd... my preference would be for flux/open/black box or fvwm on a liveCD.
I don't think KDE is heavy. A full bloated gnome is larger, slower and still less usefull, IMHO.
my opinion is that DE's are heavy, _any_ DE compared to a lightweight wm.
don't tell me ;) I use and maintain icewm.
heh, my apologies (I wasn't preaching)... you maintain icewm?!? one o' my favorites, its screamingly fast.


umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
maybe try to kill fam, if it runs
But, shouldn't I detect it in lsof output?
maybe,when I have that problem, I never find an offending process via lsof or fuser
#ubuntu is still mode +s, is it normal ?
gpdf is/was xpdf with gtk gui
I'm not sure they are still in synch.everythink in main is on the CD, right ?.from looking at apt-cache {show,showpkg}, how can I determine whether a package is shipped on the CD ?
apt-get --print-uris --reinstall install 
however I need help with this error guys please: bash: ./linux-installer.sh: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied...this isn't going to fly if I can't install any of my linux retail games LOL!!
try 'sudo sh linux-installer.sh'
yes that works BUT..i sticks me with a non-GUI installation routine..and thats crappy,kewl thx!!,good luck...I tried that and had no luck,I wound up using apt ...worked flawlessly ;-00..
well, you have to make the plugin symlink by hand still
huhu, fresh distro and the channel is already full,oh, no KDE,expect Kubuntu to appear soon,just as happened with GNoppix
hahaha,i doubt it,would need to find enough people to actually want to do something like that
experiences with Ubuntu?.good/bad?
so far..I find it very fast and 'clean'..I LOVE having no damn desktop  icons LOL,:(,ohoh ;-0
i have seen that on a plain debian install
oh hmm,well no matter..totem-xine is working fine now that I installed libdvdcss2 ;-)
need some minor help..i'm trying to install ut2k4 retail version via ./linux-installer.sh..its complaining that: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: permission denied ????
you need to do it as 'root','su root' 'chmod +x <filename>' <./filename>
su root isn't taking my password
'sudo passwd root'
thx mucho that worked
np
hmmm i'm still getting:: bash: ./linux-installer.sh: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied from doing: ./linux-installer.sh


i use gnome in fedora and ubuntu and it's not that much different.,yep,all gpl,it even works
mono repo?
see the list, for ubuntu
yeah works like a charm :)
if you get a chance can you blog about it? or post somewhere? I need to make a decision on a laptop soon and I'm strongly considering ppc.


i don't think kde is available yet
parts of it are,(not on powerpc, though),13 October,(http://wiki.ubuntu.com/WartyWarthog_2fReleaseSchedule),as I remember, the evolution removal a couple of weeks back was in fact due to the evolution and evolution-data-server packages getting out of sync and becoming uninstallable,I tend to recommend dist-upgrade (or something similar) plus paying attention,warty-*-install-* are final, warty-*-live-* still being polished
g4? talk to mxpxpod he has a solution
no, g3 ibook.
unplug the powercord and lock the lid in place then ? :),i have to do that, no idea why though
well if that does the trick then im fine
know which cli app to use to figure out which keycode is which key?
showkey
why didnt i think of that


hmmm beep media player seems broken
Broken?,I'm gonna try,it works for me
ok now it doesnt crash i just get no sound :)
I get sound.
im not getting any sound at all,not from any app
Do you get sound from Rythmbox, for example?
nope
Have you adjusted the volume controls?
is anyone else having problems with the ubuntu servers?,hrmm, xchat 2.0.8... ubuntu needs an update ;),and we need the microsoft fonts...
fonts are an interesting problem, that we'll be spending more time on (post warty, probably)
any clue where I can pick them up for now?
there's a package in universe to download them
I don't see it...
msttcorefonts
it's not there in the ppc repo
hrm. file a bug, please. i think it should be around,(you can just lift the package from debian)
su is working here ,i just used it 
it's best to avoid `su' and to use `sudo' for every time you would have logged in as root
can you explain me why ?
sudo provides accounabilty (an audit log of what as happened).  sudo avoids shared passwords (you only ever know/use your own passowrd).  sudo stops you needing to run commands like `ls' as root that you might do if you were using su or a root login
: ok i'll man sudo, thanks ,ok ok i know why i don't use sudo now, i can handle a # np i'll continue to su , your advice is a good advice tought
could you say that again, I don't quiet understand
: after done man sudo, i remembered why i don't use sudo , i can handle a root shell so i'll continue to use su 


there is not others reposity than what i get on the cd ? (can't i install kde ?),i look that ,thanks ,mmmm that's not nice for kde :/,but i use xfce4 ,i just want them installed 
xfce should be in universe, check /etc/apt/sources.list and see that you have that enabled?,policy mount
ok found the universe in source.list (i had to boot the other computer)
if the line is uncommented, then you should be able to apt-get install xfce4 or whatever
but this kde missing bother me a bit i should say 
it'll be fixed, we had higher priorities prior to the preview
alrighty, i have a few issues with the ppc build.
go for it,hmph, my powerbook doesn't even sleep, so I can't test that :-/,the /dev/pmu issue is known, there's a bug filed,will look at it before final release probably,the only effect of that is to change init's output slightly,we put it there when we thought we were going to do bootsplash for warty, and it wasn't worth reverting
 how come you guys decided not to do bootsplash for warty?
making the required bootsplash changes to the kernel fatally broke the installer.,thus, too risky => backed out
heh, i can understand that./
that's an artifact of how the CDs are organised,you're welcome
need some minor help..i'm trying to install ut2k4 retail version via ./linux-installer.sh..its complaining that: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: permission denied ????
what's   ls -ld /bin/sh ; head -1 ./linux-installer.sh   give you?,just type::   sudo ./linux-installer.sh   and enter you _own_ passowrd,what does   ls -l /bin/sh ./linux-installer.sh  ; head -1 ./linux-install.sh   print out,...had you been using sudo... :-)
yeah but i get tired of having to retype my password everytime so dont even go there,ha
you should only need to type it once every 5minutes.  And never if you keep doing stuff!
besides..my password is setup specificlly to make it damn impossible to get through anyway LOL
https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+filebug    file what you did, submit, click "attach" and attach the file from  /var/crash/...
ic ok thx..
but I think you should file a bug report against 'apport' saying that it should describe exactly what to do
what then is the 'complete report' < button for on the crash report ?,there is complete and reduced,what I mean is there is no 'ok' or anything on the gui,oh wait sorry ic now..whe n you click either it does create anew one..I didn't notice it is all..its not obvious really


you can disable the onboard audio in bios usually.you have the driver loaded properly?
i think i do 
this isnt a minipci card is it?,yes.,whats up with your debs,they seem to be corrupt
hmmm not sure.you still having a problem with the packages?
?
i noticed.does monodevelop need mozilla or just any browser?
it uses gecko also
would this be fixed if ubuntu had a newer firefox?
what are you talking about,libgecko-cil != mozilla-firefox
sorry i was making a bad assumption,so i guess there is no easy way around this
uh, i could upload a newer libgecko-cil,thats easy enough.. i choose not to because blam works fine and my time is limited
you dont notice the image loading problems?,oh well. thanks for the explanation
huhu, fresh distro and the channel is already full,oh, no KDE,expect Kubuntu to appear soon
s/no/unsupported/,it's there
I see. Very easy way to get larger distance from problems, do not add it at all.
if there are people interested in making a kubuntu, we will do what we can to make it easy for them
I imagine you could Packages files for "ubuntu compliant" packages and maintain them among others in Debian's ftp tree
if I understand you correctly, that is what universe will become.any idea about https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1153 ?
whats the package mgt of ubuntu like... can I just use apt-get (i.e. do exactly as i would on my Sarge Debian system)?
the screenshots have been done in VMWare
hmm can you request specific types of cd's on the site?,bbs,well web forum/bbs thing,phpBB is just as nice and free,oh not sure, i was just mentioning phpBB was free as opposed to invisionboard
types of CDs, as in architecture?
its acting very very odd
a single bug report would have been sufficient
awake?,had told me to remove ide-* from /etc/modules completely


and everywhere else ;)
i see... grass-roots-online-press-coverage in action eh?
has ubuntu got the NTFS kernal bug?(like MDK 10)
no, we ship 2.6.8.1
mostly because ESD is utterly broken with alsa
i use esd and alsa on my fedora box and it works just fine
isn't that the default firefox behaviour on linux? (not closing tabs)
type about:config in the firefox location bar, and then you want to change middlemouse.contentLoadURL to false.
change it
to what?
change the pbbuttonsd buttons to use the f10 and f11 keys instead of 11 and 12
so, how do I use f12 then?
after pbbuttonsd quits stealing it you can use it for whatever you want
also, when I start up GNOME, I get a dialog box that says that permissions on /dev/pmu are broken.also, how do you keep pbbuttonsd from controlling your sound device?
the pmu thing is known, and has to be fixed every boot. i dont know about the sound card thing though
do you just let pbbuttonsd take over your system?
yeah i do
do you use the gnome keybindings?
no
how do you show where the volume is on your system?
i look at the sound applet,if you assign the sound keys to the same keys as pbbuttonsd, it works fine, too.,the problem comes in when you want to use a key for something pbbuttonsd is already doing differently
actually, you can solve the permission thing using udev... put pmu:root:pmu:660 in /etc/udev/permissions.d/udev.permissions and then create a pmu group and add yourself to you
cool,thanks for the tip
that's what I did on debian,also, showkey is giving me hex codes
it should just be giving you numbers
also, do you run apmd?.do you use powernowd or cpufreqd?
cpufreq but it doesn't seem to work very well
really? did you uninstall powernowd?
no i left things as they were by the install with regards to the powernow/cpufreq thing.
try uninstalling powernowd... I have a config you might like for cpufreqd.what laptop?
ibook g3 700mhz


hello.any news concerning the live-cd ?
19:41 <             mdz > bmsleight: the live CD is currently at http://people.no-name-yet.com/~mdz/ubuntu-live/
"You simply have to load the "Users and Groups" application as a sudoer user, and then click to see "all users", and then select a new password for root user, and then voila, you can use the root user normally."
or i could sudo ... then useradd? right?
Nah, it's already there you just need to change the pass. As Keybuk said "sudo passwd" would be the alternative


what does apt-get update do?
refreshes package/metadata lists from the server
ok thanks, i didnt want it to actually update any packages
it definitely doesn't do that
is it like  emerge sync then on gentoo?
I've never used Gentoo so I have no idea, sorry,sudo gives you an audit trail,apt-cache search
im a gentoo user, is there a command that does pretend, like emerge -p gnome in gentoo?
edit /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment the obvious lines; or Preferences->Repositories in synaptic,one's deb, the other deb-src; i.e. binary packages versus source packages
You guys have an entry on Wikipedia now, you know.
the word, and the wikipedia entry, predate the distribution :-),oh, well neat,it didn't find it when I searched for 'ubuntu'
hey now,some of us are political about the license AND free beer thing
its not an issue , I was just curious
oh,hehe


uhmm... is there an easy way to 'upgrade' debian to ubuntu?
No.,You can try it, if you are brave.,http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/helpcenterfaq.2004-09-15.5117761983
why does ubuntu come with gcc-3.4 as default?
(pure guess): because it is the latest stable gcc release?
heh, oh, right,hmm...


is anyone else having problems with the hal-device-manager?,defendguin@gnome ~ $ hal-device-manager,Could not get device list. Make sure hald is running
'hald'
how can i check to see what services are running?


Anyone feel up to answering my Mark S question?
Canonical is an Isle of Man company,sabdfl
You are shitting me? 
that is one of the best I've heard yet,the latest gstreamer is already in
hmmhmm.What would be the pass for sudo?
your password
hmmm, i didnt even spificy one for it.
when you created the first user you entered a password. this is your password and the password sudo asks for
can someone help me set up my 802.11g card
what card?
2200, i have it working right now, problem is when i start up my laptop it does not work i have to set it up each time
what are you having to do to set it up?
bring down eth0, bring up eth1 then run dhcp on eth1


any french user of ubuntu here ?
moi
salut.?
?
:the inclusion of eagle usb is ok ?


hi guys - just installed ubuntu and I find there is no root,how do I 'add' root,what just sude and no root,*sudo
I just said .. 'sudo passwd root' , change pass 'su root',yeah
sup?
: Hi Mark. Just very proud and honoured to speak to you :-),: And wanted to know your nick in case I have come accross you before in #mono, etc
<blush> i put my trousers on one leg at a time too, but thank you
: Anything that SABDFL stands for?
oh yes


you're FUD-ing
explain?
                   dir_index
new extension - not as fast as doing it natively
again, FUD.  It's native and it's not a "new extension".
ext[23]  also doesn't do: extents, delayed allocation, have a repacker,yes... but is not default
hi, whats ubuntu based on Sarge? presumably it uses APT GET? hows the hardware dtection? -ive got awkward hardware,thanks Mith and lifeless.im using a SATA drive, does the default kernel have sata support?
default kernel is 2.6.8.1 with everything turned on, so yes,yep
ok thanks
sure,the ubuntu installer will work out what else you have on the disk available and set that up. dunno about any other distros (well, debian does the same)
holy crap, just because you make something open source doesnt mean that you have to give it away for nothing,you can sell it under an appropriate license
just dont see the market for it is all ,and its composed of so many other peoples code , dont see how that works,its already free , how can you charge for it
free not necessarily meaning gratis.,you could release it at no cost but charge for support,or build a service around a piece of free software and charge for the use of that software. my employers do this with mailscanner and spamassassin.


Have a look at Computer menu -> System configuration -> Networking, if you select "Properties" of any card, you can click "Activate when computer starts",alternatively, you can put "auto" next to the right card in /etc/network/interfaces, I think that's what the GUI does anyway,yeah it seems rather crashy for me too, I think there's a bug filed
heh..how else can i set it up then?,first time using a debian distro
you want to make a few changes to your /etc/network/interfaces file then,firstly, to stop eth0 coming up automatically, you want to comment out any line saying "auto eth0",to get eth1 to come up automatically, you want to add an "auto eth1" line
there isnt, there is alot of junk in there from the gnome network gui thing
I'll paste you the entire file in /query


though it certainly is ugly
and his love for gcombust =)
get used to it :-)
:),it has struck the inspiron 8200s and the d800s iirc.usplash? Any handy urls I can read up before I tread in?
the notes from the oxford BOF, I suppose
k thanks. :-),ah, thanks.
prefered to start download with this or to wait for bt tracker to come up again?
bittorrent can continue a partial download, so if you're impatient, just download and then switch to bittorrent once that's back-,it is,http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/warty/preview/warty-i386.iso.torrent (change i386 to something else if you're on some other arch)
the bt worked perfectly btw
goodie :)
say thx to the fixer :)
it's thom, he's in here.
Anyone feel up to answering my Mark S question?
he's around yes
: Whats his nick normally?
mark lives in london, the company is based in the isle of man, the name is zulu or xhosa, i forget which
: Fully aware what it means. I am South African. ,: He might live in London lately. But he is still South African. He spends alot of time here still
for sure
: Didn't get what Mark's nick is btw :-)
jeesh. i didn't think SAB was a choice, more an imposition :-)
: Nah. A way of life more than anything :-),: Windhoek is always good too. Castle is goes down better in large quantities though.: You have memories?


hrm.so this project is completely open source/non-profit ?.funded by the shuttleworth foundation ?
no, for profit, funded by the same guy who funds the shuttleworth foundation
for profit 0_o.you're a big mono developer ?
nope
so why is Jstrike so happy to meet you
i expect we share a common interest or two
is that a good idea if you're using universe ?
it won't actually install new software, just update the software that's on your machine
morning all.does ubuntu have an rsync miror?
yes, but please don't use it unless you are going to set up a full mirror yourself.,or you can use a mirror,http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/Archive
that is why i want it, i wish to add it to my mirror cluster which is goin glive next week, with just about every linux distro i could find
there are rsync URL on the URL I mentioned above.
thankyou i shalll add that to my nightly rsync.is cdimage.ubuntu.com in the uk?


where are the IDE drivers?
in the kernel packages.can you be a bit more specific?,I've done dozens of Ubuntu installs using IDE devices
udeb packages ide-core-modules and ide-modules are present in /install/initrd.gz. they're not present in /pool or /install/netboot/initrd.gz
ah, gotcha,you're looking for the udebs, then,/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-kernel-di-i386-2.6.what sort of install are you doing where you need the udebs on the CD?
tried to install off a loopmounted ISO on another machine.
ok, please file a bug, Component: debian-cd, Severity: enhancement, and we'll see what we can do,no, in that case, it's already reached the correct person,it should be retitled, though,s/kernel/linux/
you know what the problem is , I just specified it,dont talk to me like im stupid and being vague,I said .. gnome-icon-themes conflicts with kdebase .. and you said they had a common file , which is the problem,Sirus: sudo passwd root , su root .can you add regular debian unstable sources to apt ?,kdebase:,  Installed: (none),  Candidate: (none),  Version Table:,I gotta backup a bunch of stuff
did you apt-get update after uncommenting universe?,put an empty CD in the drive; gnome's dvd/cd writer will pop up, it's a fairly usable  GUI
yeah I know nautilus cdburner , I NEED k3b =] 


<- retarded,weird,network connection was down *shrug*,no idea why it didnt work,seb: as a user , everything always worked never had any package problems,I use main,'used',stable .. whatever.potato ?,heh
k3b is installable now, working OK for you?,segfaults when?  it starts up fine for me
ugly ?,why doesnt X have aa fonts ... I just noticed that


!,the problem is obvious , kdebase wont install,However the following packages replace it:,  gnome-icon-theme,E: Package kdebase has no installation candidate,you know what the problem is , I just specified it,dont talk to me like im stupid and being vague,I said .. gnome-icon-themes conflicts with kdebase .. and you said they had a common file , which is the problem,Sirus: sudo passwd root , su root .can you add regular debian unstable sources to apt ?
calm down, dude.why not use mkisofs and cdrecord?
cli retarded ?,I'm cli retarded rather


hrm.so this project is completely open source/non-profit ?.funded by the shuttleworth foundation ?
Have you even read the GPL?
no , probably why Im confused
The GPL simply requires you to redistribute source code along with binaries.
oh , cool
By only giving it to people who pay you, but they can of course get it from someone else.,Alternatively, you can could charge people to meet special needs like porting software to new hardware.,Or to translate documentation to a new language, etc.
true ..
Cygnus was the first company to profit off of GPL software and they did so by charging fees for support or porting gcc and gdb to new embedded systems.,You might be interested in reading this: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html
yeah checked it out , interesting but not convinced the model works
You know the saying about not telling the people doing something that it's impossible? :-)
no , never heard that saying,but , I never said it was impossible


Definately something wrong with the CD...although it's quite weird that two people can get broken CD on exactly the same package.,I seriously suspect something is not right with the Ubuntu i386 ISO. I've burnt it now twice on two different computers and on read them on two different CD's and I get reading errors ...
worked fine for me,this might be the weird DMA problem some machines have
I usually haven't had problems with DMA. Is it a problem specific to a kernel?
i'm not sure, but we had the problem on a machine here. worked most of the time but d-i produced read errors. turn dma off, iirc hdc=nodma is the trick in grub
Hmm, ok. A Debian ISO of Sarge works perfectly though, so that's a bit strange., And the fact that I barf on bsdutils and the guy on the mailing-list does the same.
hal needs to be told what devices are cameras.  i think it knows about the ixus by default, and the eos-300d was added today iirc,check info.capabilities (iirc)
On the Device tab I have a label "Capabilities" and that says "Unknown".
run a locale for .fdi files, you'll need to fiddle with that. then report the changes
Ok, I'll try that..So you're saying I should try to adapt canon-digital-ixus-v.fdi to IXUS 400 according to what I find in Device Manager?.Ok, I've now changed usb.product_id according to Device Manager for IXUS 400. Do I have to name the .fdi file to something special for it to work?,YAy, with that change it not Just Works!:-)


!,the problem is obvious , kdebase wont install,However the following packages replace it:,  gnome-icon-theme,E: Package kdebase has no installation candidate,you know what the problem is , I just specified it,dont talk to me like im stupid and being vague,I said .. gnome-icon-themes conflicts with kdebase .. and you said they had a common file , which is the problem,Sirus: sudo passwd root , su root .can you add regular debian unstable sources to apt ?
http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/helpcenterfaq.2004-09-15.5722653677,when you edit your sources.list, you need to apt-get update afterwards
I did ...,I dunno how it didnt work .. but I tried again and it did .
you obviously have never used sid
sid == unstable ?
well, that's why they call it stable,as has been mentioned to you, KDE and friends are in "universe" are unsupported, and my not work,not to mention it's a preview release
hey now,some of us are political about the license AND free beer thing
That's fine, but it's still wrong to equate the two in the general case.
that i agree with,the two should only be an issue to those who want to MAKE it an (informed) issue
Right.
well, when a mommy livecd and a daddy livecd really love each other..., i have no idea, by the way, who's responsible for the livecd.,no it was another "java should be included and who cares about OSS" troll
Oh.
the paid version of mandrake also includes all that stuff
Does it include the flash/java packages themselves, or just the auto-downloader/installer?
includes the packages themselves i believe.
Is it?
yes, but i'm not sure what the latest documented version is - might be the latest release, might not
Ah, I think I found it...
http://www.schleef.org/swfdec/ is the project im talkin about :),might be a combo of both if swf isn't still open,no,the ONLY thing that makes up for all that damn compiling (possibly) is the whole USE flags thing


hi guys - just installed ubuntu and I find there is no root,how do I 'add' root
use sudo,yes, that's now considered the more "secure" way to do things,I would suggest keeping the sudo roue,er route,http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/helpcenterfaq.2004-09-15.5722653677
yeah yeah got it now mate - tnx n e way
it's essentially Sid frozen at a certain date, plus bugfixes,and then there's some newer stuff, like GNOME 2.8
so IT IS safe to dist-upgrade to sid then
you can dist-upgrade to sid, but the results might not be perfect
ok then, shall i just uncomment lines in sources.list and then apt get update
yea.. if you want packages that aren't in main or restricted, uncomment the lines with "universe"... it'll have most of the pkgs from sid
these would be sid packages only and not experimental and similar
yea, sid
tnx mate
but not current sid,frozen at the same time as ubuntu,type linux26 at the install prompt at d-i ....
can you build kde from source ?,or are you guys going to fix the package system,MacPlusG3: whats wrong with ext3 
it's slow and doesn't scale
whats faster
XFS, reiser,XFS is my preferred
by how much
(and not just 'cause i work for SGI)
sgi has offices in .au ?
quite significantly in some situations. large files and many files in a directory esp,yes - there's the Australian Software Group down here in melbourne
what are the average % .. how much faster is XFS
depends what you're doing. but, for example, an mkfs takes about 2 seconds with XFS... i shudder to think what ext3 takes on a few hundred gigs,on large directories - ext3 does a linear search. XFS is O(log n),ext3 can run out of inodes. XFS allocates them dynamically
nice
XFS *loves* B+Trees. for free space, for directories.,it's extents based, not block number based. so big files are really efficient
how much of a problem is it to convert ext3->XFS
use tar,or some partition resizing and copying (if you can),there's a convertfs program that's meant to automate some stuff
would that filesystem have any advantage as far as multimedia/games ?
for multimedia, yes. XFS is used a lot in big media housess,a lot are using CXFS these days (clustered version - commercial product)
I mean just for dealing with alot of mp3's , wav's , games .. etc
probably be a little faster. most likely noticable,but no gaurentees
why did you guys replace kdebase with gnome-icon-themes,thats lame++,fix that crap,how do I modify the apt-get/dpkg database so that I can install kde .. without uninstall gnome-icon-themes/rest of gnome,whos genius idea was it to REPLACE kdebase with gnome-icon-themes,!
do you know what Replaces is ?,that's just to overwrite a file from an another package
what kind of question is that
"whos genius idea was it to REPLACE kdebase with gnome-icon-themes"
they conflict with one another , why ..
both package have a common icon file (same path/name)
any way to force install ?
more details,no, you said replaces, that's not conflicts
you just saw the error , cant you read ?
yes, looks like you don't have any source to install kdebase,"no installation candidate".apt-cache policy kdebase ?,yes, but better to add universe source
I UNCOMMENTED the universe sources already
apt-cache policy kdebase ?,that's not a conflicts, replaces, or whatever problem, you just don't have a source with this package,it's in universe.you "apt-get update" before ?
yea man , ran debian for years , thats why I knew to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
ok ...
I think they just fixed it recently .. cause I tried it multiple times why streaming audio,so net connection couldnt have been down


obviously it's not in warty.
build from source
uhmm... is there an easy way to 'upgrade' debian to ubuntu?
doubtful
it's not enough that he's a swell guy? ;-)
sure , but .. I thought there was something else
uhmm... is there an easy way to 'upgrade' debian to ubuntu?
it is not recommended at this point :)
Does anybody know how to get msttcorefonts installed?
if you have the extracted ttfs, then just point nautilus to fonts:// and drop your ttfs there
ok.where can I download the fonts from?


Definately something wrong with the CD...although it's quite weird that two people can get broken CD on exactly the same package.,I seriously suspect something is not right with the Ubuntu i386 ISO. I've burnt it now twice on two different computers and on read them on two different CD's and I get reading errors ...
have you checked the md5sum?
Yes, it matches.
if you burn it, then read it back using dd if=/dev/cdrom | md5sum -, does the md5sum match?
I'm doing "md5sum" on the CD device, and after a while I get reading errors.
if dd if=/dev/cdrom | md5sum - does give you read errors, you have a problem with your writer, somehow.
I have burnt it at my place and now at a friends house, so the burn is okay. The *reading* could be a problem perhaps.
yes, either the reading or the writing, then. :),it's a preview release.,we're not using the urgency field for anything.
sorry to intrude, but what runlevel would I set as default if I did not want X to start automatically?  I've checked the debian docs(as I'm new to Debian) and I have noticed that there is a gdm script that runs in all runlevels 2-5.  Thanks
there is no runlevel muckery
oh?  what do you do?


nice :)
hello there
how's ya laptop doin'?
trying our fine distribution?
thinking of :)
it isn't. thom's strong-armed me into buying an x40.
just downloaded :),dang u stil didn't get it fixed? :/,that sukxkrz,still an x40 would be nice :)
the x40 is love
machine died?,me impressed :)
glad to hear it :)
btw. any chance you'll fix the whole apt-get install ruby thing?,it would be wonderful if ubuntu got a proper apt-get command line tool :),(merging of apt-get and apt-cache, listing of close matches when a pkg doesn't exist, etc)
aptitude's probably pretty close to what you're after
headless box :)
aptitude's console,if our ruby packages are lacking, you're always welcome to join up and help fix them :)
probably will do.heard of rpa?,rpa-base.rubyforge.org (iirc),ruby production archive,like. a maintained cpan :),(i.e with debian quality q&a),aptitude rocks btw :)
rad
i'm impressed. you guys actually really do have a clue :)
google is your friend :P
thanks dude :P,how about u save me the gg time? ;)
never tried it
ouch. found evil guru m$ hints,yay for google :P,i'm awaiting an ibook next week,and no. no linux :P
dude, you should've got an x40
i can't be standing this linux/m$ shit anymore dude.how heavy and how many hours?
1.47kg, ~6h with WiFi (anecdotally)
oh very yummy,what stupidly high price does it come to? :P
in australia, ~$au4800 with the extended life battery (11h), dock, etc, etc
whats that in us?
about $us3k, but you can get it cheaper
just reinstalled my work desktop with the final preview ISO,ROCK,apart from apt hanging for 20 seconds before starting a download
sudo might timeout on gethostbyname
nope,it's just like debian "main" "contrib" "non-free",debian stable unstable testing maps to warty hoary perky etc in Ubuntu
debian woody, sarge, etch maps to warty, hoary, perky.
I don't see much traffic on the ISO mirror
I inferred this from your comments on mailing lists :-)
because the stupid license forbids fixing some security bugs
oh, yes, I remember now,no, the free alternatives are getting quite good,regarding patents, the universe is a big place...:-)
does it have a resize partition tool on install ?
I don't remember.,nope, it doesn't use cfdisk, we're using a slightly modified debian-installer, which doesn't use cfdisk any more.
and how do you manage partitions?
debian-installer uses cdebconf, so it has a custom program called partman.
morning
'morning
dmesg doesn't report a synaptics, but X was configured for it -- but there's no module installed for it
hmm, so that shouldn't be doing any harm,maybe it does all that in the hardware then, and you explicitly have to turn it off
heh,plenty of time for that.i'm a little confused about something. ubuntu is based on debian, but it supports amd64. how does that work?
we integrated the work done by the debian amd64 folk, and as Kamion says, we just rebuilt,there are a number of infrastructure issues, plus amd64 really needs gcc3.4, so debian will need to plan and do the g++ abi transition at some point
TongMaster/beezly: cool, thanks
imagine, DRI working *OUT OF THE BOX* on a TiBook, FFS. it's a miracle :),released? e17? I was using two years ago, it was pretty good but I think it's been re-written twice since then.
nod,i was excited when i was using EFM ;-),everyone and there dog uses different ones


uhm, is there a way to specify an http proxy?
computer menu -> desktop preferences
I mean during base-config,ping
pong
Mitario is around


given how much I move stuff around; I'd probably use arch
arch can't check out subtrees, though, so you would have to use configs or something
I like the idea of tla build-config configs/tilde-dsilvers
is contrib in universe?
Not a clue
internet works for me.
so is warty-i386.iso live or just a d-i disc?
: ?
the wiki mentions a livecd somwhere. wondering if this is it or not.
: livecd is based on morphix,: at least the last one I tested,: if you have a couple of spare gigs you can install from the hd installer CD,: ohhh
not installing grub seems to confuse grub postinst and subsequently ubuntu-artwork
please file bugs
you haven't released yet, no?
preview release, then.
okie :),was just checking, but it seems Progeny doesn't do amd64 these days


heh,thats me,theres 73 people fighting over 55mbps
and you bounced my connection once, maybe during the thread increase restart? :)
yeah, sorry
:) wget -c is my friend
does anyone here use ubuntu on ppc?.is there a ppc live cd?,oh crap... I gotta get home or my wife will kill me,I'll talk to you guys tomorrow!,I noticed that ubuntu already has gnome 2.8 in too :D.is there a ppc live cd?
afraid not
suck
(but it's one of the things I want to look at, as a powerpc porter)
I'm scared to install ubuntu w/o checking it out first...
depends what you mean; warty started out as a snapshot of sid, has been worked on by variously syncing new versions from sid or by making Ubuntu-specific changes,yes, but not on /boot,oh, hey, you're on ppc - should be fine then
cool... my /boot is ext2
you can either tell the installer to format them, or you can say "use existing data on this partition" (or whatever it says)
awesome
definitely use the manual partitioning option, of course
of course :)
oh, you do, it's just that your yaboot.conf is like that already ...
hehe
if the username on the other partition maps to UID 1000, then it should just work (by luck)
how do I check that?
'id bryan'
sweet... 1000.what group do user's files get set to?
the same, 1000,Ubuntu uses per-user groups
hmm...
provided that your other home directory is chmodded g+s, you should be fine
"other" home directory?
sorry, your existing /home
and how do I check if it's g+s?
'find /home/bryan -type d | xargs chmod g+s'
hmm
setgid directories mean that new files created in that directory have the same group ownership as that of the directory itself, regardless of the user's primary group
ah, ok.what about my old files in those dirs?
they're fine, the point of the setgid bit on the directories is so that you can leave them that way
oh, ok.and this isn't insecure?
never heard of any problems with it ...
ok, just making sure.if my home dir is already there, will it overwrite my .bashrc when I create the new user?,sorry I'm asking so many questions
if the home directory already exists, adduser leaves it alone
awesome,just so you know, I've got my users set up on debian to have their own group.. so I'm chown'ing all my files in my homedir,the users group is left over from my gentoo install
ok,patent concerns,you have to.in what way?
I see that the latest iso's have a date of 10/13,oh, ok,n/m
3.3
so, why does libgtkmm-2.4-dev install g++-3.4?
because it depends on it, I assume ...
:P.why would it depend on it?,if 3.3 is the default
maybe it triggers a bug in gcc 3.3 or something? I have no idea,I'd suggest looking in its changelog."haven't been updated"?
I just did an apt-get update and nothing was d/l'ed
we released warty yesterday, it will not be changed further apart from critical bug fixes
so if I want the latest, would it be wise to switch to the hoary repo?
... which doesn't exist yet
is ubuntu going to update gaim to 1.0.2?,oh, right,ah, ok
udev creates that; it's a copy of /dev from before udev started
why does it keep it?
emergencies
ok, why does /.dev show up now, but it didn't used to?
"used to" in what system?
:).so Oskuro was that bad?
well, if you play fanhunter, oskuro rocks for the villain,lol
wtf is fanhunter?
rpg
and there's a character called oskuro?
no, there are characters called Xtremo, ridli, constantine....where r u from?
Valncia
so, it's a spanish role playing game, by cels pinyols, one of the villains is curro jimenez, it's a parody,forget it, i'm OT
does anyone here use ubuntu on ppc?.is there a ppc live cd?,oh crap... I gotta get home or my wife will kill me,I'll talk to you guys tomorrow!,I noticed that ubuntu already has gnome 2.8 in too :D
with gnome-media 2.8.0 and epiphany 1.4.0 :p
:P
what version of gtk2-engines-* do you have ?
2.8.0-ubuntu2,sorry... -0ubuntu2,just so you know, I don't think you're lame :)


heh,plenty of time for that.i'm a little confused about something. ubuntu is based on debian, but it supports amd64. how does that work?
we're based on Debian's *source* packages; we rebuilt all of them for all our architectures,everything that just worked on amd64 we didn't worry about, but we had to fix up a number of things
so you did your own porting?
please send us lspci and lspci -n info for that, it's usually trivial to make work,if this is a sata_nv chipset, I just uploaded support for that today
nope, it's an i915
we froze warty before d-i RC1
i hope your and debian's d-i can be parallel branches
I'm a debian-installer developer as well as an Ubuntu developer; I have a very strong personal interest in keeping the two as closely synced as I can, to reduce my own confusion levels if nothing else.
great =D


: night
you don't need to,it's basically the canonical administrative list.. it used to be the only list but everything has been moved to other lists now,totally, later.rosh hashannah?
: yes! how did you know? :)
i'm not jewish but went to the jewish community center near my home every day after school for maybe 10 years :) i know some hebrew, songs, etc :) seemed about the right time
: 10 years? you're practicly more jew than me :).: will sounder@ be notified of all relevant new mailing lists we can sign on?
yeah, jdu can fill peopl ein
: sound and ubuntu-devel are the same?
yeah, jdub can send a message to sounder telling them about the new setup,i think so, jdub can tell what he did
: ok graet!,: has it been so loud here since i left? :)
it just got loud,we just hit /.
does anyone here use ubuntu on ppc?.is there a ppc live cd?,oh crap... I gotta get home or my wife will kill me,I'll talk to you guys tomorrow!
ubuntu just works, debian needs love
heh
i'm running sid on my laptop for DD work, but my work desktop is ubuntu and my home desktop will be shortly. its lovely :),the gnome menu reorg by jdub/seb128 is really nice,it used to do some weird checking for the system spamd and was very picky
suck....where do you work?
small startup in london
and do you work on linux/gnome stuff all day?
i wish!,i've spent the last week wondering why a smartcard chip isn't responding to a reset
fun stuff
seb128 is lame
haha
reinvent the wheel like a real man
haha,it's not the latest bakery that uses gtkmm2.4 and libgnome-vfs2.6
gst-xine is in experimental,i mean universe of course
you mean totem-xine


heh,plenty of time for that.i'm a little confused about something. ubuntu is based on debian, but it supports amd64. how does that work?,oh, i see
heh..you grab the ISO from my workstation yet?
yep
rock.
running the installer now
w00t
no shit!,what? kde packages? explain.
600M is ridiculous for a default install.,And the idea that you need at least two CDs to install a base system is ludicrous.,last time I looked it was under 100M,heh. True. :),although they only have Xorg 6.7, not 6.8
this install is 1GB with GNOME
That's not the point. That's not the *default* install. And it's definitely not the *minimum* install.
ok. could have sworn it was default, but hey
what install are you talking about? an ubuntu install, or a debian one?
the one that worked (debian)
because last I checked, a 'default' debian install doesn't even include X, dude.
*shrug* ok
hence, the bitching, about the bloat. :).so how are you digging ubuntu?
uh, not very much seeing as it won't install
heh.
: there supposed to be no icons on frsh install
read back to what i said :)
does anyone here use ubuntu on ppc?
I'm downloading it :)
hm, stracing apt-get shows it spinning on gettimeofday(),aha, apt is looping on a select(13,...) which is timing out
ls -l /proc/`pidof apt-get`/fd/13
a pipe to somewhere :)
Hmm :-).probably one of the method helpers?
yea, i guess its the http method
and that is doing... ?
they are both hanging on a select ;)
both on a pipe?
dmirror.wolffelaar.nl ;)
what is Invision?
as calc says, http://www.design2i.com/debian/ is an example,it's even not distributable by non-free, too


hello ppl. im runnin debian/unstable and i want to try ubuntu. can i just change my /etc/apt/sources.list and dist-upgrade my way to ubuntu?,its the rough edges that worry me the most
if you worry about rough edges, reinstall.  this is why i keep /home on a separate partition :)
good choice. now you can have >2GB partitions ;-)
I had that before,what a sorry excuse
(or even keep /home under Version Control!)
 i wish i knew how to
cd $HOME; cvs import /var/cvs x y z (etc.)


nope,it's just like debian "main" "contrib" "non-free",debian stable unstable testing maps to warty hoary perky etc in Ubuntu
your new nick rocks
are you serious about that?,RAD!
ahr, ok
is it that day today?
which day?,yes it is!,heh
so what's all of this fuzz about the WartyPr0n?
yeah
cool,I see the headlines. "LINUX GOES ANTI-CHRISTIAN IN THEIR RECENT RELEASE 4" 
wassup with howl atm?
won't build in sparc & arm iirc
ooh, i can test it on sparc :),rad!,ubuntu-ca would be ubuntu canada anyway ;-) ;-)
uh?
there was a joke in there,i guess that's alright,dunno about website though
well, it would add a pointer for Catalan users to the apropriate list.,in case it's ok, the link is http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-catalan/,well, gotta go. If you can ask this for me, I'd appreciate it.
will mail you about it
danke
not these days
ping,just mailed you..saw the mail? Do you think anything else is needed?
nup, that's fine, thanks,unfort, i was hoping to put most of that stuff in the second week :|
fuck!
we can sort it out :)
great ;),"coger" is a word you use dozens of times every day (to pick up, etc). It means "fuck" in Argentina. :P
GOSH! ;-),you like the news? :)
here we've considered Ubuntu, but not right now. Hopefully after Perky we can seriously talk about it.,our first release will be Sarge based


I believe Enlightenment 17 will be very good... Should try it someday.
well, should it ever get released ;-)
I think EFL is released... eh, pre-released?,I read some docs on Enlightenment Foundation Library and it made a lot of sense.


does anyone here use ubuntu on ppc?.is there a ppc live cd?
I'm already installing ;)
really?


mmm, shiny new amd64 box just arrived this morning
abit kv8-max3 is what I have,I am blinded by the rice..you haven't booted it up yet?
still in the box ...


Hello all!.Anyone  knows if ubuntu supports network installation throught wireless usb device  (atmel chip) ?
not quite,the firmware is not available in the installer,but after installation, it should work out of the box,it's included in our standard kernel
The gnome 2.8 release notes seem to imply that evolution 2.0 supports Exchange accounts (without a separate plugin).,And it also mentions supporting Rendezvous without any reference to libhowl.
it's a plugin. it was installed by default for me in ubuntu.,exchange support, that is
thanks.do you have libhowl0 installed?
and nautilus support dns-sd to discover things like file shares. doesn't seem to need libhowl to do it, either.
mmm, shiny new amd64 box just arrived this morning,hi jono, will try to reply to your mail soonish
cool, which one are you?
/whois :-)
ahhh cool, nice to meet you Colin,Aq (Stuart Langridge) mentions you a lot
figures, we've known each other a long time :)
cool
/dev/pmu is the power management device on powermacs; the error dialog is a GNOME bug
ahhh right
basically, yes; only main right now, although we were discussing that at the technical board meeting earlier
cool, so may non-free be made available,its worrying me a little that I may not be able to use debian packages in ubuntu
at some point soonish that will probably happen, yes, although there's still a bit of debate about the implementation
so is the idea that when Ubuntu upgrades to a new version, a simple dist-upgrade will get everyone up to date?
right,if anything more is needed there'll be a warty->hoary upgrade tool or whatever and it'll be announced, but hopefully it shouldn't be too involved
right,it would b e cool to do a simple upgrade to everything.will the upgrade include universe software?
sure, universe will be resynced
surely the dependencies in universe must be huge?
correct, which is why it's hard to recommend using Debian packages,we get away with it because we rebuild the entirety of universe from source
right.is ubuntu going to allow newer packages to be installed in between releases?
the hoary development repository will be open during development, if that's what you mean
ahhh right, so if a new version of Blender comes out and is added to debian unstable, I assume it will be in the hoary repo?.did you get a chance to look at those questions I mailed you btw?
yep, AIUI hoary universe will roll along with Debian sid until the UpstreamVersionFreeze,hm, no, totally snowed under, I'll try to get back to you soon though
this process sounds good - have a freeze on hoary to get ready - would'nt surprise me if Debian takes this route at some point,I realise you are busy dude, thanks for bearing it in mind though :)
yaboot doesn't support passing an initrd parameter on its command line,you'll have to boot from the CD, run up to partitioning, switch to tty2, chroot, fix /etc/yaboot.conf, run ybin
what d you mean run up paritioning?
ctrl-f2 definitely won't work,try: alt-f2, alt-fn-f2 (pressed in that order), command-f2, command-fn-f2 (pressed in that order),nano,alt (or whatever)-f1
I did take it out, and I thought that was why it broke
oh, if you're using that config file then you must use an initrd
to patch the orinoco driver - I am testing it for bug 1438
ah, maybe just substituting the single module would be easier
I tried that but it didnt work
the details of the technique are d-i specific; the general idea is, well, general.'depmod -a'?
wont that overwrite my modules file with the modules in 2.6.8.1 directory as opposed to my stock kernel 2.6.8.1-3-powerpc?
yes, debian-installer certainly isn't the only installer to do this
cool.when I mounted my disk behind the installer, I used /dev/disc/disc0/part6 - is that MAc specific or common with all installers at that point?
partition numbers obviously vary, the devfs-style naming is common to all d-i architectures currently,it'll probably change eventually, for obvious reasons we want to move away from devfs
why is /dev/discs/disc0/part(n) used instead of /dev/hda(n) ?
when d-i was originally being built there was no sensible alternative to devfs
are you heading down to the Linux Expo in London?
when is it?
you should come down :)
might nip down for socializing in the evening
we have to go at about 7pm on the 7th, but we will meet up for sure.I do karate too - which belt and style are you?.cool, which club?
oh, I'm just incapable of driving cal, yes, I'll come down on Wednesday evening then
cool,ping
pong,both at the same time, if I have anything to do with it
heya man :),it was great meeting you the other day,it was a shame I couldnt stick around a bit longer - I was running around like a headless chicken - when you freelance you have a thousand bosses ;P
yeah, understood, will try to swing up to Brum sometime and meet up for a beer
yeah, sure :) I still need to buy you one, no probs, you seema busy chap at the moment
hopefully workload'll drop a bit post-warty for a while.no?,note, FWIW, that the installer still uses devfs.
oh really? thats interesting, why is that?
historical,that part of the installer was written before devfs was deprecated, and it's a fairly big upheaval to shift
what would I need to do to persuade you guys to include Blender as a program in main?
typically used to transfer control to ntldr or similar,if you use 'default saved', then menu entries with the 'savedefault' option will become the default after they're selected,it's a map of the positions of symbols in the kernel, for use by things like depmod and ksymoops,http://www.dirac.org/linux/system.map/
cheers :),ping
wow,Channel just keeps getting bigger and bigger ;0.How would i check my processor fequency from a command line?
cat /proc/cpuinfo
 thanks.
the legality of mplayer is EXTREMELY questionable,debian does not,availability does not mean it's included :),yeah
hi all.heya jdub - hows it going dude?
relatively sleep free ;)
I bet :D
/etc/gdm/gdm.conf
cheers
might be easiest to install totem-xine from universe
ahhh really, cool :)
debian main, unsupported
cool, so normal debian packages integrate rather well then,all we need now is a driver driver to allow a stable ABI in the kernel and ubuntu will rule the world :P
stable ABI == puke :-)
but the driver situation is madness my man...
ugh
any manual compile of drivers is wrong
plug a device in, hal detects in, loads the module and it just works.,that's the process you want.
how do you do that for drivers not within the kernel?
you provide them in another package if they exist.
but then you need a new module for each minor point kernel release
not necessarily, you have source.
but compilation is bad for the user
you're assuming binary module damage and lack of freedom here. :-),nothing to do with the user.
I dont believe all binaries are wrong - so long as the source code is available
if source is available, you're fine. no problems.,we're releasing every six months.
are you confident you can provide a module for every point release of the kernel inside ubuntu for every driver both in and out of the kernel?
every six months, there'll be a new release, with new drivers and (often) kernel.
but do you think you can cover all bases with the drivers - as much as I truly love ubuntu, I think its pretty impossible, even with six monthly release cycles
what do you define as 'all the bases'? we'll have new drivers in our kernel every six months. if a driver doesn't exist, we can't do it.,they won't install point release kernels that aren't in ubuntu.
I mean drivers outside the kernel too
we're talking real users here, not us.,we have a bunch of drivers from outside the kernel, that's the plan.,dude, normal users will not be "stuck in kernel compiling land", they won't even start.
agreed if you are 100% positive the distro will detect the hardware and asign the right driver
if it doesn't, that's a bug.,sure, and that problem will end.
I know a lot of users who have a device that is supported by linux, their distro does not pick up on it and install a module and they ask a LUG or friend how to get their device working and they are told to compile a module - that is main problem - this is not a bug in a distro, its a limitation of the kernel
it's a bug in the distro.,we're going to fix that bug.,and why shouldn't they? that is the goal.
but this level of reliability is simply not there in any distro
i know. :-).and why not? WHY NOT?,no cleverness involved, just work.
I think the problem is that the current system does not scale, it may be manageable now, but in 10 years the management of individual modules is going to be huge with the new devices
we,we're not talking about the current system,you need to unassume. :-)
do you have something up your sleeve ;)
dude, solving this problem does not require something up my sleeve.
hehe,ok dude, we will agree to disagree :).well we dont agree, do we?
i don't think you're grokking the point, really.
ok
that's a different problem, and if that's your mission, good luck to you. i don't think it's what we need to do to solve the problem.,go to bed. :)
huh?,ping :),ping.will you have time over the next day or so to answer a few q's for the Linux Format review of Ubuntu?
sure
cheers, I will send them tomorrow :),ping
pong
I am gonna mail these questions now - if you could get them back ASAP I would be grateful - I am reviewing Ubuntu now :),sent :).what time is there?
0200
ahhh right
more g-s-t stuff as it comes along, but, um... NOT YAST
heh
you should be reading planet gnome...,there are some rad ones in the making, including a disk setup tool
I do read planet gnome - well, I try to keep up :),disk setup, cool :).are you guys at Canonical actually hacking on code such as g-s-t to expand what they can do?
not a lot.
ahhh right
(at this stage, anyway.)
right,got it now :)
developer or user?
user - funky things to configure the desktop etc.I am not seeing an admin section - am I blind?
gconf just stores settings. it's not designed to be cool.
heh
that's said quite a bit, but it's not really true
how so?
stuff that is in gconf that is not in the ui is the exception to the rule. it's not a design choice that they should be there.,more often than not, what's in the ui is in gconf.
yeah, but there is still a filtering process in which options are mapped to typical user needs - this does not happen in KDE for example
that generally doesn't involve gconf though,lots of people get that wrong,gconf is the storage and notification mechanism for settings
ahhh, I see
see CoG and gTweakUI for some settings that are not exposed by the gnome ui
cool :),oh, good work on ubuntu recently by the way, you guys are doing a great job :)
why do you need it in main?
I was just curious which apps go into main and what the criteria is - universe is only synced with unstable occassionally isnt it?
the upstream version freeze applies to the entire distribution at the same time,throughout the non-frozen months of hoary, it'll be synced daily. then case-by-case sync requests for bugfixes after that.,so there's no update regularity benefit,none of us have the expertise required to *support* blender,but people who do could make it nice in universe
right - so is the syncing occuring at the moment now warty is out?
yes, look at the hoary Packages.gz
ok cool, thanks for explaining this to me :)
ubuntu doesn't use fstab sync,because munging configuration files makes baby jesus cry
got that right
it requires patches elsewhere too (it's not really a member of project utopia)

pong
no worries, sorted it now :),ping

we (openadvantage) are looking to get ubuntu working on an OQO (www.oqo.com)
great
we would be happy to lend one of the units to canonical to get it working, would this be of interest?
almost certainly
great, I am just testing hoary dailies on it now,the mouse seems to be the problem at the moment
could you please mail myself and jane.silber@canonical.com
I will mail you now
just been reading about those today
they are really nice machines
zippy?
zippy?
speedy?
yeah it seems so,and its got bluetooth and wireless,sent,I figured Colin Watson may need to poke around with an OQO to fix some installer quirks
our installersmith and laptopsmith are both in the uk,handy
exactly :),well I can always head over to meet them if needed
thom generally does laptop-oriented stuff,mjg59 does lots of power management stuff (he's not canonical though)
I am using a centrino chip
someone on lugradio has no idea what marketing means
which person?.what is he saying?.as in, we are rambling, or as in we cover lots of different things?

ok, you lst them?,cool, I will make a point of shouting down the phone :P.well we can record your interview a bit later if that is more convenient, maybe 9pm GMT ?
possibly a good idea, let me know if you can
yeah, that is no problem,could you mail me your phone number to call you on, or I can send you my number if you would prefer to call me instead,LUGRadio Season 2 Episode 8, featuring yourself is out now at www.lugradio.org
/etc/sysctl.conf
thanks, what is the keycode for F10?,ping,ping,ping


man latin1 ? :),Or hit ctrl-k then e' in insert mode in vim...
so single octet per character, using the msb to make it pritty
yeah, it's 8-bits per char.,man latin1 :),(or man iso_8859-1 if you prefer...)
in insert mode, LANG=POSIX, c-k, e, " gives me a quote character...,but ' works...,damn fonts
What is the default root password?
there isn't, use 'sudo program'
with qtparted?
or just parted, but yes,though not while you are using it
you can only use so many cards at once also
yes, but when you're testing X, a large diverse number of cards = very good
yes I meant reasons for you not keeping them
ahh .. heh
hi.I have a weird problem - I had ubuntu running fine, then when I rebooted the machine, gdm would not start, I typed startx and the screen goes all fuzzy - when I run startx as root it works fine - any idea?,any idea how to fix this video problem.is it something to do with /dev/pmu and incorrect permissions - what is /dev/pmu?
that X stuff sounds like random complete arse
random complete arse? huh? :P.any idea how I can fix it?
no idea, sorry -- since they both use the same config file, it sounds impossible
yeah - its weird
yo
heya man.hows it going?
not too bad, you?
good, just figuring out why my sound is not working in ubuntu
hey dude
heya man, hows it going?
good thanks, you?
not so bad, just woke up, I have flu though :(
ugh :\,rad.like it?
I gave it 2/10
heh,gnome-system-tools, and I believe there are some more int he works for specific tasks (e.g. X),'evening
heya buddy
thanks dude,hey,hey dude,heh, cool,yeah, awesome new year, had a bit of a break which was nice, so just been getting back into work this week
same here, I rarely touch a computer over christmas, I get away and then when I get back I am ready to rock in the new year :D
aye :)
incidentally, good job on x.org, I upgraded to hoary recently, and it all works great :)
cheers mate,it's been a lot smoother for us as well
good stuff :).do you know anything about the progress of (a) graphical boot and (b) the hardware database (I assume by hardware database, this is a PRoject Utopia FDI file DB or something)?
usplash is coming along pretty nicely and aiui should make hoary; we haven't made massive inroads on the hardware database yet though, I don't think
is the graphical boot in hoary now?
not yet, no,they're on cdimage.d.o.what's an OQO?
http://www.oqo.com/
cool,wow, that's bizzare,at Ubuntu, mainly mjg59 (although he works on Ubuntu in his spare time), thom, and myself,yah
but the package that the bug relates to does not pop up in the packages text box?
oh, right ... just file it on 'linux'
ok cheers
awesome :) how'd it go?
it went really well - we love doing the interviews, and it will be in the show released on monday
sweet,ifupdown, I believe,(it's generated in postinst),hey dude
read your blog entry about x.org, sage words my friend :)
heh, thanks dude
ping
whattup
do you know how the OQO is doing? has cjwatson mailed it onto you?
i'm not sure, sorry -- fairly sure it hasn't been sent my way yet.  you could always ask him :)
I mailed him and no response yet,he seems to have been away from IRC too - maybe he is sick or on holiday or something

that's it,nice to have canonical staff on the irc support channel,I must admin that ubuntu looks GREAT,I've been using debian for years and the thing that pisses me off more is the long periods of time of the stable distro, and the lack of commercial support. Both things can be found in ubuntu while maintaining the debian philosophy. Definitely great. Congrats dudes
commercial support? ;)
doesn't canonical provide paying support for ubuntu ?
?? You can hire a consultant / support company for Debian, there is a list in the Debian docs
: unsupported packages don't get bug fixes ?
we don't concentrate on them too much, but we're very open to fixes and so on from the community :_)
: are you an ubuntu employee ? (well, the company that supports ubuntu whose name I don't remember)
things like build fixes and so on would be great,yeah, canonical,yes
yes what ? :-)
commercial support
umm, it has x 4.3.99 isn't it?.or it's 4.3.0 ?
it's a 4.3.0 heavily patched
ah, ok, thanks for info
np :-),it would be nice if you can tell me how X will behave
you can count with it
thanks,yes. all our documentation is registered
seems right, X starts
did you get any question?,about X config,good.. i was expecting only one since qemu uses a VESA amulation,not for me.. thanks a lot!
yes, we've been using it in development,we use quite different monitor autodetection so the two aren't comparable; file an xresprobe bug, I guess
you don't actually need to look in source.list, synaptic can change repositories on the fly...
or that, yeah,apt archives on CDs are pretty easy to do
but they are not that easy to install from, because the user has to use apt-cdrom or whatever
should be possible to wire that into Synaptic -> Preferences -> Repositories -> New in a nicer way
if they could just put in the cd, and tell synaptic "This cd is an apt source", they could install from it instantly; if the apps on the cd could also show up in a new application-level package manager, a user could just click on the app icon in that list, and go
# has a special meaning in menu.lst ... update-grub parses it
simplifying here, in examples it's not important,386 is what I got
there's been one daily build since the release candidate, with essentially no changes,quite a few, see the warty-changes list archives on lists.ubuntu.com for details
Great, thanks for getting gamin in
i'm trying to install it in qemu, under sarge, and i'm writing a little review in spanish about it,in qemu, installation (i'm here) seems to work allright,so i'm doing one,scrollkeeper is taking a LOT of time to be configured here
took me well over an hour
similar here, then,if you want hosting or a web to write it, tell me
since you have done the same install, you probably have a lot to add to it
ok, but mkcow it's easier :)
edited the wiki - your suggestion seems to end up to be the same as m one
the same?.can you explain that?
slighty :)
:) ok, it's very well edited,it's very well like this :)


don't you have one very similar in your laptop?
um, my laptop is dead :)
ah, ok, i thought you had the same graphic target as me
um, the laptop I used to have had a mach64
so i was wrong bout that
we've got 320 fairly well covered by keybuk
ok then.ubuntu has cpufreq by default ?
i believe so, yes
thanks.r u in mataro?
yeah
going there today or tomorrow
cool!
tomorrow at 17.30h more less,have you seen jane there? i have to talk with her
she's away, sorry; is there anything I can help with?
ok, I have a first draft of a howto for using qemu - any suggestions what I do with it?.send to the mailing list?
perhaps mail -users?,should be pretty good,modulo wifi support :|,we want to do i* for hoary
thing is, I've used i* in the past, and I was surprised how much smoother uim seems to be
mmm, seems it's the growing standard though - so best to support and improve it...,perhaps we can provide both if it's easy to handle
true.real example?
including japanese input support and fonts
yep.
versus a tightly honed, minimal firewall derivative,bouncing a sacred animal is a bit over the top, though.,it's not package-dependent
how would apt know what MIME to register a packaged mplayer handles, for instance?
talking about gnome packages,if mplayer had a .desktop file, it would work too
uhm, where do i tweak stuff so i can fetch normal debian packages? i need gossip and texmacsa,texmacs i mean
just enable universe in your sources.list,that,that's what i am working on right now :-),for the preview release is a bit rough.. for final there should be a simple command like: nvidia enable or nvidia disable
hurry up, i will need my daily fix of Enemy Territory soon ;)
it won't be in the archive before monday or tuesday. i need to test it heavily
any website / mailing list or whatever where i can find progress updates or whatever? 
in the meanwhile you can install linux-restricted-modules and nvidia-glx,dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 to enable the nvidia driver,echo nvidia >> /etc/modules && modprobe nvidia,that's what you need to do
k
there are mailing lists (see topic) but i don't post on a daily base like: "addeded 20 lines to this script or that one" ;),i usually do an announce or something when the time is good,deb http://jrfonseca.dyndns.org/debian ./,well it works here with that debian packages
what package do i have to choose?
hold on a sec :-),no problem,well it's not the most recent version of java, but it works fine here,if it doesn't for firefox, fire up mozilla.
does that include libdvdcss2?
nah, that's okay (i have it here),the stuff in christian marillat's proprietary/scary media repository seem to work okay,depends how well apps/libs start using alsa
one new issue, it took far too long to add a new user to all the groups needed to actually do anything...
a secondary user? yeah, we want to make that easier
cool, something else I don't have to write a bug for
a bug would be good :-),let me know the bug number
1430.  Any stupid mistakes I blame on Family Guy
we do in many cases
morning? you've got that wrong for a start
.au, dude :),it'll only list stuff from supported,if users know enough to want to go down the universe path, they can do so with synaptic or so on. :-)
Kamion, anyone I was talking to earlier, some thoughts on packages: http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~psh103/temp/packages.txt,do you have any plans for switching to gamin, I don't want to have to be jealous of this new Fedora....Thoughts on deleting from removable media/drives?
Capri: there will be a tshirt comp starting sometime this week
but where's the logo? I vote for a little known and unpronounceble mammal
thunderbird will be updated when debian updates it
actually, they have already, missted that; good suggestion EricNeon
it ought to be in hoary soon then
too late! I'm annoyed with the broken evo now! :),has anything bad happened to users-admin recently? I seem to have thrown myself out of video and plugdev by running the latest version
on hoary/
yes, the version with the fancy UI for selecting groups
could be broken in hoary :)
bios maybe or move card to another slot if poss.
its a laptop...
imbecilidades 8),estoy buscando mis pantalones  <- my only spanish :)
is there someway to remove it from gnome-volume-control in the mean time?
oh, no unfortunately,i believe that will be fixed in gnome 2.10,so will be much nicer in hoary :)
would you be a good person to ask about utopia and usb drives?
hopefully :) what's the prob?,that is totally non-utopic.can you plug it in while hal-device-manager is running?
glad you agree, it all shows up in device manager fine,if I run g-v-m in a terminal, it tells me it won't mount, the normal bad type, superblock or whatever message
ok, do you have another usb-storage dvice?
good suggestion, my iRiver worked fine (other than calling the window being called sda1 rather than anything sensicle)
yeah ;).okay, can you compare the lists of properties in the 'advanced' tab of hal-d-m?
ok, but my pen will mount fine manually, so...,damn, it won't see any usb drive now... and sidenote, you can't kill a system process without a the root password, so that dialog is pretty useless in system monotor
can you file a bug about that dialogue?
will do, have to wait till tomorrow now, I'm tired and usb is annoying me
thjanks
update on that usb drive thing yesterday, it works ok with a new mbr, FAT16 partition type and FAT16 formatting; before it was W95FAT32 and FAT32...
interesting,yes, known bug
is esound planned to stay? alsa recommend dmix these days I think
we don't actually run esound on startup,if we can autoconfigure dmix, that'd be rad,but thus far, that seems almost impossible ;)
well, I've only ever used one config and it seemed to work, guess I might look into it.  My main comp has an SBLive though, so I haven't thought about it much
yeah, let's just give everyone good sound cards ;)


umm, jdub isn't it a good idea put apt-watch by default in a panel?
you can if you want, we'll have a solution for that in Hoary,we chose not to use apt-watch, but we'll have something like it in Hoary
ah, ok,i said, personal review :).but only security fixes ?
build fixes and so on, but not new versions
perfect
we are not doing security support for universe
ah, ok, that's interesting (and comprehensible),i like that way, it's very inteligent.umm, not exactly sid, isn't it?
it's sid frozen a couple of months ago,yeah, there are some extra things we do
are you spanish?
no,but i have been to spain for guadec :)
i never go to conferences, i'm very busy in my work,preguntale a tu novio si los tiene
put it on the FAQ page for now
ok, thanks,trukulo changed the topic of #ubuntu-es to: http://mercurio.homeip.net/blog/31/ <- info ||  < jdub> estoy buscando,hei, i'vew found your trousers, come to #ubuntu-offtopic jdub,you have to say to me if you need something special for the conference,he's talking about marillat repos,ok
there is the entire rest of the internet available for non-ubuntu discussion...
i'll help tyche, stay working
:-)
do you have a gun for me, please?.can you give me a hand please?
with?
with live cd , glxinfo gives me DRI yes
daniels is the man to ask
Isn't KDE included in the ubuntu APT repositories?,;)
uncomment universe in  sources.list
i prefer term "gilipolleces"
gilipolleces suena mejor :)
it means "arsehole things, more less"
:D
the lsb init functions have bash-specific syntax on line 76,I did an upgrade from a debian system that had dash as /bin/sh. Nothing restarted as a result.
which part of that line is the bash'ism?
no idea. try running it under dash.,#1325


installing from CD? looks like it might be a dodgy burn, high-speed writes have been known to be problematic sometimes
that would make sense, not a very clear error message then
yeah, sorry about that, it really means "retrieve" rather than "download"
should I submit a report to bugs.ubuntu?
guess so, yeah, we can at least make the message clearer,package base-installer, assign to cjwatson@canonical.com,something that doesn't exist yet, but was being discussed at the last technical board meeting ...


lots of patches being generated :),pbor: dude :),pbor: nice to see you here :)
warty looks great... I'll test it out a bit on my desktop (I'm not yet used to debian) and then I'll prolly go for it also on the laptop
cool!,yep :)
thanks... I'm a deb noob :)
you're not the only person thinking about this.,the fact that I have a different day job now which happens to involve Debian doesn't mean that I'm not working on Debian in my spare time any more; I used to have a day job which *didn't* involve Debian.
you are right. In fact, under the same circumstances I would do the same thing - look for a Debian related full-time job.
we'll be doing jigdo, but it's not set up yet,however, a local sid/sarge mirror wouldn't help you anyway,(oh yeah, azeem said that)
but do you provide a suspend script for acpid, to stop/restart hotplug, save mixer settings etc.?
Oh well, yet another fork.
but one giving a lot back.,http://www.no-name-yet.com/patches/.what bug?
Ripping out 'brltty' makes 'libbrlapi' unusable.
pardon?,no, please point out things, though you might stumble over non-bugs, you might just as well stumble over bugs as well, and we would very much like those fixed.
it could be great if the user could be asked if the time should be set from the hwclock or the internet during install
ubuntu installs ntpdate which syncs automatically on boot
o.k. it did not work during this install .. my computer stalled, and to get going I needed to press ctrl-c 
stow with /usr/local, or /opt/
I store it in my home dir, but I was wondering if there is a tool used in ubuntu to keep track of the files installed, so I can uninstall and upgrade it,aha, ill look into it
dpkg-reconfigur locales
that seems to be the way,Thank you


then it's stupid.,though, it might work.
the right way costs too much manpower
no, it doesn't.,the right solution is probably < 3 man months to implement.
then ubuntu will be the first Debian release with amd64 support ;)
ubuntu _is_ the first Debian(derived) release with amd64 support.
is it based on pure64?
somewhat, yes.,we've taken patches from pure64, but we've also done some things ourselves.,I've been NMU-ing stuff in Debian as well as working on ubuntu, Kamion has been doing d-i work while working on ubuntu, lamont has driven his buildds as usual; that we include a bunch of DDs doesn't mean they stop working on Debian.
though, Sarge is not released. Ask you why. Ask you about what can be done to change the situtation. Ubuntu derivate is nice and has deserved its place under the sun but after all, we are Debian developers and should force the main distro into a releaseable state. And not play around with other stuff and let the sinking ship sink, deeper and deeper.
I'm working on Debian, but that doesn't pay the mortage.,trust me, I run a bunch of servers with Debian on them, and I would _very much_ want to see sarge out the door soon.,afaik, no.  Talk to Kamion. :)


the option not to copy everything over is archive-copy=false, right?
archive-copier/copy=false,actually, the installer really uses devfs at the moment, not udev,don't think so,daily ISOs are still being built, but they aren't actually being made visible anywhere at the moment due to a problem with the bittorrent stuff
btw, do you mind and i386 upload of that? Seems it's only available for powerpc and alpha
not at all, go ahead, I meant to do it myself but didn't get round to it
I might do it, when I get around and don't forget :)
boot normally, run through the UI up to partitioning but without actually finishing the partitioning step, switch to tty2, mount your root partition, chroot
worked perfectly, thanks a bunch,nope
they're useful for some strange build-deps,we opted to tune for P4 instead,no I'm not ...
oh, it was getting such a nice running-gag
adding an epoch would have made it gratuitously difficult for people to "upgrade" back to Debian,we use "ubuntu" suffixes on version numbers rather than pretending we own the whole namespace for pretty much the same reason,yes, there's one linux-source-* package for all architectures
is multiverse aimed at potentially including all of Debian's non-free, or just specific packages?
I *think* anything we can distribute, but I haven't paid a great deal of attention to it,might well be just on-demand
hmm, ok,there are around 10-15 DDs, however, another bunch of non-DDs develop as well
most of the non-Debian developers are working on other things.did you mkswap it?
eh :),cheers


I have a quick kinda newbie question about the install, could someone possibly help me out?,When I installed, I had to use the noapic and nolapic option, or else the installer would hang before it got to the language detections screen.,After a successful install, the system reboot, I get "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel." And then it hangs, it won't go any further.
the noapic and nolapic options don't currently get copied into your grub configuration,it's on my list of things to fix before final release,in the meantime, press escape at the countdown to get the grub menu, and edit the kernel line of the topmost menu entry, adding 'noapic nolapic' to the end,you're welcome,that wouldn't help with traffic costs,shipit.ubuntulinux.org
yes
: i suppose it comes from sid?
faik yes 
: doesn't load over here
well i'mi having load times everywhere now.and mozillla just crashed on fresh boot into linux this AM although I had to manually do dhclient ;(..anyway...is mozilla 1.72 known to have issues any idea ?
: well, is it the upgraded version on your warty? i can upgrade and try also
its what came with ubuntu
: ok, let me check that,: mine's is 0.9.4. I will try to upgrade and than let you know what happens.
odd..well if yours is OLD version then maybe mine was upgraded ( and Ididn't realize it obviously :( ) during apt session LOL
: probably - i am upgrading now
k thx...I hope this doesn't give you instability issues too ;(...we may both need to quickly head back toa diffrent version LOL
: nahh, that's ok,. worst case we'd downgrade the version.
so odd..nwn.bioware.com was working great in windows...it might be just coincidence and bioware might well be having off and on problems LOL!!,yup
: i guess so it's a coincidence, although I don't have a win to check..:)
yes its mozilla
: ok, how did you make a final conclusion?
seems to be anyway...its consistenly hanging t rying to get to a download ...
: well, my upgrade still didn't finish. I am waiting for it to
i'm tryhing to get opera download from their site..for sid..its trying but hanging up consistenly,ok,yeah i'm sure now...its consisstenly barfing by my just trying to get to a certain download location..,ie: it should just say 'page not found' or keep trying to load it and just give time out error but its crashing,got it that time LOL..ie: opera download..whew ;-00,just in time too..firefox crashed again LOL,opera is browsing normally now  whew..yup its defintely mozillla,something is borked in 1.72
: send me the link again
nwn.bioware.com.any luck ?


installer problem I mentioned to you http://muse.19inch.net/~jr/tmp/ubuntu-installer.png
Kamion should be able to help,probably best to start off on UniverseProposals.around?.what's the global location for that default?
not sure if there is one, it's set in kdelibs/kdefx/kstyle.cpp  (and it's set to plastik by default in KDE 3.4)
ahr.,was hoping to find an industrial/human like theme for kde, and set that as the default for ubuntu
is that the theme used by GTK in ubuntu?
industrial is the gtk+ engine, human is the 'metatheme' in use and gtkrc mods to industrial,'flipping' the "ok" and "cancel" buttons won't make it anything like gnome :),(erm, that's fallacious too, don't fight fire with fire please)
yes, I'll shut up now
it guarantees the freedom of the GTK+ and GNOME platform library code. this is a very silly point to argue, dude.,the kde depends are scary, dude,even kde-core was a bit whack,hope you guys can slicken them up a bit :).btw, do you know why arts doesn't have split up backend packages?,currently it requires libjack and thus jackd - eeek!
I hope we can too,never looked at arts in that way I'm afraid, will note to do so.someone likes Yann Tierson?
amelie soundtrack :),i think some of the fluendo guys will be there,we're teaming up (canonical and fluendo) to do streaming for linux.conf.au
you have a large upstream?
no, i'm upstreaming this to my linode server, and mirroring it there
can you put this in the /topic http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kubuntu-devel/2005-March/000023.html
mdadm.i guess you don't mean from install?
nope, install did raid 1 for me, now I need to read up on how to do the other disks
ok, mdadm is the right answer then :),it's pretty easy, and there are good docs on the web
any idea what the opposite of mkraid is (to destroy a raid)?
just reformat the disks and turn change the volume type if you made it autodetect,also, don't use mkraid, use mdadm
what about backgrounding it, like dhcpo?,dhcp, sorry
hm, risky, I can imagine programs getting confused by the time randomly changing under them
is there a reason why ssh is not installed by default?,shiny even
the ssh package is now just a dummy package depending on openssh-client and openssh-server,this'll go into Debian too post-sarge
Bad interpreter? Wrong libc?.is there a .jigdo file for the ubuntu images?,because my internet traffic is expensive, access to the local Sid/Sarge mirror is not
they have rebuilt main, they don't use the official Debian packages
stub: oh, back home?
Yup
not smp -> that's for multiprocessor,hyperthreading is only available on p4/xeon afaik,you want 686,killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus gnome-panel
That got my bottom panel back and my background, and nautilus window appeared. Still missing my top menus and applets.,same bottom panel is fine. Top panel is still unresponsive and blank,Oh.... not the same. The second time, the virtual desktop applet and trash applet didn't load,The bottom panel is inactive too - no response if I right click on it (but the show/hide desktop and window-switcher applets are runnng fine)
guys is it okay to add a real live debian unstable branch..I need audacity and its not in unbuntu ..????;-)
you mean this one???  universe/sound/audacity_1.2.1-1: Installed [optional:uncompiled] .or which arch are you looking at?
kewl that works ;-0,nm I forgot about universe..warty is only one in default sources.list ;-0,of course ;-),hmm odd..pretty sure mine does default..lemme check,yes mine load mozilla for example when I click them


who do I talk to about making a bakery2.3 .deb for ubuntu?
we sync off Debian, so you should get it into Debian itself.
it's in debian itself
seems to have been added after we snapshotted sid?,late June, iirc.,unless jdub or somebody tells me otherwise, I think it'll be in hoary (at least, in universe),run a locally compiled version?  Or bribe jdub into accepting it? ;),but you can look at it another way, we'll be starting on hoary fairly soon, so you won't have to wait forever to see bakery2.3 in a release. :)
hello all, I have some questions about ubuntu...
this is the place for it,very much so
I am interested in commiting time to a distro, but debian is to political, and fedora to closed.  Are developers pretty welcome here?
definitely :),join -devel
good ;)  How do I get involved in the graphical installer here?
well, work has not really started on some of those HoaryHedgehog goals, but join the list, and you'll hear about them as soon as they start ;)
where is a good todo then?
bugzilla.ubuntulinux.org 8),also, on the wiki under HoaryHedgehog
I can see you love a good bum rush ;)
the HoaryHedgehog page has our broad goals for the next release
how come mplayer is not on apt?,o_O.It is?,hmm...,Strange.,Every other distro includes it tho :(,Mepis did, odd.
: redhat does?
fedora, yes.
: it's included codecs and usage, is convtroversial,: i'm after a night without sleep, not paying so much attentionto spelling mistakes ...: what brand?
 no bog deal.
: i found that there's a bios setting that makes the proccesspr worl full power on ac,: should be there somewhere, however be adviced that this can cause the machine to heat up a bit
well, i believe its already set up that way.
: unles you've changed that, it's probably not.
i get "/dev/dsp doesn't exist" when trying to play sound... what could i do?
is alsa-base installed?
yes
what sound card do you have?.is the snd-ens1371 module loaded?
how do i check (sorry, i'm new to linux)
lsmod | grep snd-ens1371,if that returns anything, then you have the module loaded.
no...
if you try to run modprobe snd-ens1371 , does that work?
wait: snd_ens1371 return
hm, a bit weird, then..could you run dmesg | less and cut and paste anything looking like it has anything to do with the sound card in a /msg to me?,arrows to scroll, q to quit less.
i'll try,thanks for helping
my pleasure. :)
the only line with sound is "devfs_mk_dev: could not append to parent for sound/audio"
if you look for 1371, do you find anything?,/1371<enter> will search for it.
negative,i tried dmesg | grep 1371
could you rmmod snd_ens1371 ; modprobe snd_ens1371 ?
ERRO: Module snd_ens1371 is in use
ah, ok.  Sorry, mea culpa, we're chasing the wrong bug..is snd_pcm_oss loaded?
do i check with modprobe again?
lsmod | grep snd.pcm.oss,. matches anything
with grep oss it finds: snd_pcm_oss, snd_mixer_oss, snd_pcm, snd
hmm.. this is getting weird.  Does cat /dev/sndstat tell you that you have some audio devics?
yes, it finds the devices 0 (tv card) and 1 (es1371 (duplex))
and you have files named pcm* in /dev/snd?
yes. several
do you have a /dev/dsp file?
yes
ok, then it's probably just esd not running..if you run esd -nobeeps, does playing music work?
when i run esd, it tells me "/dev/dsp: No such device"... strange
that's weird..esd -d /dev/dsp1 ?
hooray.. 
ok, cool. look at the bug Tomcat_ posted; there's a workaround in there,but as mdz writes in the bug, we need to fix this properly.
hmm 5:00 am is certainly morning jdub :)
1200 (noon) here, i slept pretty soundly after all the release action ;-)
: me also, but only one day of rest. there too much action since :),: ironically you used "soundly" to describe how well you slept :).: on wiki?,: hi, just wanted to ask what's ubuntu-meta pruporse? I've wondered around it's code a bit...
it's just a meta package with dependencies
: oh, so to fulfill the need to allow people who are not installing from scratch to get new introduced pkgs?
yeah
: apt-get can't find it, other suggestions?,: oh righty, it's so taken for granted on my sid that I forgot. thanks
it's not in sid...
: no, I have the deb source in sid..that what I meant :),: I don't get it. I left the download for lamont,: 's cd, and it hung up at 93%..,: any known problems on the server there? I can't resume it etc
i don't know
: you know if rsync is for anonymous access on p.u.c ?.: I mean, if it's available to those who don't have an ssh account there?
rsync on people? dunno
: ok, I,: 'll stick to gnome download manager :).: does it have a .deb yet?


which codecs should i use for totem..xine or mplayer?
xine plays alot more video formats in my experience
http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/
is that your real name?
Tollef Fog Heen, as it says in /whois
i dont know what that means, but its my cousins name
what Tollef means?
yes
it comes from Torleiv, which means something along the lines of "the ancestor of Thor" or "the one who comes after Thor".  (Thor being the Norse god of thunder.)
i installed build-essential but it dl'ed just that, is it just a meta-package? did it not bring other stuff with it because i already had all the packages like gcc etc installed
correct.


is there a reason why ssh is not installed by default?
it is, but the ssh server is not started, I believe?
no, fstab is handled/wrapped by pmount,AFAIK
I'm just reading what the README.Debian in /usr/share/doc/gnome-volume-manager says
it's not updated I guess,file a bug


it needs to be in fstab for g-v-m to work the way you want.
it is in fstab
used to live in WA
you moved just in time, we havent gotten any rain this year
Has anyone else had trouble getting the binary nvidia driver working?
it worked okay for me
so you installed the kernel source, unpacked it, and set Nvidia setup
the kernel modules was already there.  I modprobe'd it manually first time. then added it to /etc/modules ,i just apt-get nvidia-glx plus what i said
i noticed alot of people on osnews were whining about no cd burning app, can you not install k3b? or is it just a matter of adding the right sources? is it in universe?
nautilus can burn. ,i think they have been slashdotted,the link comes up if you wait for ever
got it,thats a pretty positive review


there is a cd burning app,just put in a blank cd.
this i know, but audio cds, vcd's and the like.what you trying to get working?
ifolder
did you install ifolder from cvs or alien the rpms? i couldnt see src files, but i am half blind :)
both.
nah im looking at the site, couldnt see tars, but just thought id check with you.did aliened rpms work ?,ok, been meaning to check out ifolder for a while
I can't get it working in windows either. :-/
bummer,they fixed it so it only works with suse enterprise server, heh
apt4rpm works great
i agree, and i hate there are multiple versions of apt itself
right
and that the bloody apts install there own source list,precisely
heh I was the same way.,I have this theory with fedora and debian. Fedora gets me 80% there in 30 minutes. Debian gets me 100% there in 3 days.


where do I find the logs from ppp? I installed ubuntu on a friends laptop yesterday and couldn't get pppoe to work. There were no logs in /var/log/{syslog,messages} and "plog" didnt show anything either 
perhaps adding 'debug' to the options in /etc/ppp/peers/foo helps
reiserfs is totally weak,xfs fo life
word.
?.what was the whole "I chris lee" comment about?
I didn't know who you were, heh.
Do you recognize me now? :)
I, for one, welcome our new freedesktop.org overlords.
:),Yep.,ha. no. I work for Red Hat, dude.,I have to keep an eye on our competition so that we can crush them easier. ;)
yeah I know ...
I'm kidding. daniels is a good friend of mine and works for Canonical. And I love Debian distros.,I run all RHEL and Fedora Core at work
yeah I know. No need to explain to me. I dig your guy's work.
I hate RPM. :) - but I really love the stuff that we at RH do for the community at large, so I have no qualms about working there
got to check out walters' presentation on selinux at last weekends ohio linuxfest.
heh. yeah, walters rules. :),well, part of the problem is that there isn't nearly as nice of a separation with RPM as there is with the dpkg utils,totally.,heheheheh. exactly.,which is why Canonical is nice. :),meh. I would kind of trust walters' packages of rb, personally...
walters rules. He's all quiet and reserved.
heh. until you introduce him to your mom.
so wotcha work on for the hat? X?,your proprietary linux will fall to the mighty open solaris empire.
heh.,later on,don't smoke'em all at once


anyone else figure out how to migrate evolution 1.4.x mail to evolution 2.0 under ubuntu?
should happen when you first run evo2
i got an error when i first started evo2, then it prompted me to setup my mail accounts and started normally,but it didn't migrate anything
hrm, d'oh :|
the error was something about not being able to start evolution datastore or the like properly.how do I reset evolution to get the first time prompt again?
delete ~/.evolution,*not* ~/evolution ;-),and then perhaps check /apps/evolution in gconf-editor
I have that backed up ;),this is a clean home dir btw,the only thing I did was untar my evolution directory into home,err... ~/,no dice,wait a minute,let me do that again ;),ok, after evolution-2.0 --force-shutdown, deleting ~/.evolution and ~/.gconf/apps/evolution and then doing a kill -HUP on gconfd, re-extracting my old ~/evolution into my home dir, and then restarting evolution and starting evolution-2.0 for the second time it migrated perfectly, accounts and all
heh, that's how it's meant to work first time ;),great ;)
so I think the evolution datastore is squirrely,at least for new user accounts,oh, and I dunno that it makes a difference, but i'm running amd64 here
hrm, probably not.so you had a totally new user account, unpacked your evolution dir, and ran evo2?
yep,just finished setting up my system, logged in, unpacked my evo dir, ran evo2, kablooie
okay, so, i think this is a good upstream evo bug
wished I had grabbed the error when I saw it
it basically means that if you don't have existing evo config (in gconf), it won't correctly migrate the actual data,can you ping the evo guys about it? #evolution on gimpnet, or bugzilla.ximian.com
if I can reproduce with a new use account
cool
thanks,sleep time :)


where do I find the logs from ppp? I installed ubuntu on a friends laptop yesterday and couldn't get pppoe to work. There were no logs in /var/log/{syslog,messages} and "plog" didnt show anything either 
/var/log/daemon.log or syslog
I must admit I didnt check daemon.log, I shall do so later


hi.does the install-cd of ubuntu support creatoin of reiser4 partitions?
no
hrdwr_BoB: yesterday I asked you about screen res (I could only get 1024, not 1280). FYI I have fixed this by re-installing and picking the correct res during setup! thanks. 
you should be able change this by doing   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86,although thanks for reminding us that it's actually easier for most people to just reinstall...
(_axel: I can't get video, sound is fine :)
any hints?
not really I'm afraid, other than the normal check modules, then check that alsa hasn't set your volume to 0


anyone else figure out how to migrate evolution 1.4.x mail to evolution 2.0 under ubuntu?
you could probably do a file->import and choose the mbox file.
dude, i have like 300 mbox files,that would take forever


if I want to rerun the X auto-setup, do I just do the same as for debian, as it says in XF86Config-4?
the comment in XF86Config-4 is correct, yes.,if you haven't modified the file by hand, you can just run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
is the X setup at install the same as the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 one in principle?


-_-
loool,GEIL RAM
duud those flashing lights mean that your RAM is working


ya thats the first thing i ran into,i was like wtf i never set a password for root,sudo would work for most ppl, but i need root im just so used to doing it that way
sudo bash,and you're root :)
hello everyone,can i slip in one tiny question? :) i was wondering which trash applet is described in the ubuntu faq,is it written by ubuntu people or an external project
it's yours
ah, that clears the things :)


hello everyone,can i slip in one tiny question? :) i was wondering which trash applet is described in the ubuntu faq
probably the trash can in the lower right of the default gnome desktop?
yeah, i mean, does it has a website or st?
seems to be part of 2.8,"Michiel Sikkes" (C) 2004
bah, what is dookoo doing in here
i use ubuntu on one box :(,tory convinced me :/,how would you check to see if fglrx is working? :o i'm trying to help someone get their ati drivers working and i have no idea how to tell if it's loaded or not
glxinfo's output is marginally more useful than glxglears.did you send him to #ati?
he followed the binary driver how-to :/,nothing wakes me :(
the one thing that made me so happy was not having to tinker with crap like ALSA
oh god yes.
I posted in your ars thread (HELLO.JPG)
oh, heh.,you .... RULE.
I don't think we're supposed to have that but whatever :P
yeah me too, I keep calling my local novell guy
any idea on the hardware support of a brand new thinkpad t42? :)
totally rad :)
I shall try it as soon as I get some free time
quite a few of the devel team have ibm laptops
excellent to hear
and one of our goals is 'totally rad' laptop support,back soon :)
does anyone have a centrino laptop with suspend to disk/ram working?,i have a sony vaio z1,everything works,cept for suspend,ya brightness and speed step,radeontool,sonypi,you can set it up so the function keys work,to adjust the brightness and sound 
how did you manage it?
http://graphics.cs.uni-sb.de/~rainer/linux-vaio.html
you also running ubutu?.is everything on that link?
you have an apt server address for that?
which?,you add 'universe' to your deb lines in sources.list
i assume the universe packages were rebuilt to work with ubuntu?  the webpage said the stock debian files are not recommended
yes, it's all ubuntu-built.whereabouts?,did the name pique your interest? :),quite a few of us, yeah
have time for a question please?
i wouldn't recommend that.why don't you want to install the default desktop?,there shouldn't be enough to cause confusion. it's designed for your mum. :-),it should be fine as-is,it will be harder to get a fully working system for your mum otherwise
hi man NICE to see you here...howz one of my NWN buds doing ? ;000,think we'll get nwn2 ? ;-),would seem we would ;-)
really?.you're _that_ neighborlee?,heh
na..this is just a close similarity LOL
where have you seen that we will get nwn2?
happypenguin.org,it was mentioned a few times...
hm,the info Ie seen has been mostly negative
, Neverwinter Nights Roundup < search for that
nope
,Neverwinter Nights Miscellany < and that
on happypenguin?
linuxgames.com
ahh
sorry I thought it might be there too but I guess not,odd,those scoundrels!,heh,I shall shake them limb by limb!!,lol
hm,the roundup piece only mentions the nwn patch,nothing about nwn2
Finally, there's been some followup on the NWN2 and Linux front: an Obsidian developer posted the following statement concerning the status of any future Linux port:,posted by Crusader - Tuesday Aug 24 06:33:08 2004


was it easy to install nvidia drivers?
yup
axel: is it automatic or manual... I'm not too familiar with Linux yet!
mostly automatic,still have to edit a config file by hand,sec,rolling a cig cant type
get from nvidia website or through Unbuntu package manager?
k, i can type now,what you do is:,1- apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-<yourkernelversionhere> nvidia-glx,thats like 20mb download,so start now,after that, you do 'modprobe nvidia',that loads the kernel module,then you do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86, go through all the config options which should be already set to the correct default and select 'nvidia' driver rather than 'nv',and then you uncheck GLcore and dri from the list of X server modules to load,then you do 'cat nvidia >> /etc/modules' and zap the server with ctrl-alt-backspace to have it restart,the X server i mean,after that, you should see the nvidia logo before the gdm screen kicks in
thanks axel, I got to say Linux fans, that it's much easier on XP!!! 
well,it was much worse when you had to build the driver yourself and get the full kernel source and mess with broken symbolic links and etc,yep, its mostly nvidia's fault
I hope so!.given that there are very few 3d games for Linux, do I really need to update nvidia drivers?,k
Enemy Territory is pretty fun,and you can play some games with winex too, and doom3 for linux is just around the corner... thats if you like mindless first-person shooters
sarge always loads my alsa and oss modules, so nothing works. ugh.,nope, for final
I had that problem as well, for me it was discover vs. hotplug,heh, with ssh? that is novel.rsync?
don't think so with rsync.,yeah, so like, you can open up one that is connected to ftp, one that is ssh, and drag and drop between them.
I just did, that is very nice,I hadn't used gnome until saturday :)
i'd like to install java on ubuntu... how can i do ?
if its not in the ubuntu archive just uncomment the 'debian' section in /etc/apt/sources.list ( use synaptic if youd rather since it comes preinstalled ),su
*cough* funroll-loops.org
I love that 
edit .bashrc, and comment out the PROMPT_COMMAND line


a debian based distro with the very latest gnome attracked me.,anyone know of a tool to use to suck in my kmail inbox to evolution
create an imap server, use kmail to move the mail, and then point evo at it
ok thanks


the device nodes will not be called what you're used to,if partman can see them all, it must be working ...
but it isnt working at all
what did you mean by that? you said that partman could see them


Heya Daniel!
you here ? :)
Figured I should poke my head in ;)
welcome :)
after starting an xterm from a gnome menu, I get the spinning pointer for about 10 seconds...any idea why?
is your computer really slow?
1.2ghz.


does anybody have a clue how i could install??
try making partitions again
i have important data on my partions and they are ok...,and i have other linux distros running, now gentoo
umm, so partman, of d-i, can't see the other partitions?
apt-get install nvidia-glx,modprobe nvidia,sed -e s/nv/nvidia/ -i /etc/X11/XF86Config-4,restart X.
thx,simple and clear
just curious, is totem-gstreamer crippled on purpose (patent/legal issues) or we can expect to see the proper plugins in universe in due time? (if the former, why xine is there?)
yes, we have only totem-gstreamer and no ffmpeg plugin for legal reasons,btw plugins/xine/... in universe are ok
not sure if I parse it right... would for instance be ok have the gstreamer ffmpeg plugin in universe?,or it must go in an indipendent repo (like livna for fedora)
I think so, I'm not an expert on this plan, but be have xine which contains some ffmpeg parts ... so I guess it's ok,universe in not the supported part
nautilus?,oh nice, i didn't know it supported that,i knew Konquerer did that,yeah, sftp,they call it something weird,yeah fish
The "Connect to Server..." feature is awesome.  It is my FTP client, my laptop/desktop connection, filesharing network between friends.
i heard the latest qemu cvs is even faster than pearpc


its an pretty slick way of mounting shares,it finds all shares on the network,then u can just select them and it mounts them to a directory of your choice,yeah..it works good..,but,say in rhythm box i wanna import a folder from a share,when i get the dialog box there is no "network" menu item,so i get browse to them,get = cant.you understand what i mean?
if it's mounted it shows up in the bookmark section of the file selector when you want to import music in rhythmbox.
well i can go to the shared music folder in nautilus no prob, but i can not see it in the file selector of rhythmbox
go to file->connect to server in nautilus, choose "windows share" as service type, type in your info.,then all your gnome apps will have a cool little shortcut to it in the file selector.,the cool thing is, you can do that with ftp, ssh, etc. etc.
thanks for that...works like a charm...am i able to view those bookmarks i made other than in a file dialog box?


sniff
correct spelling, wrong pronounciation :)
aren't you supposed to be at the pub?
leaving now
what's the xorg equivlant to change the refresh rate?
xrandr -r 60,define the 'default dvorak keymap'.
ping.  sgtshatta has an interesting case for you
pong
d-i totally rules.,it'll rule even more with a GUI frontend.
i don't need gui, but it will be good if it has
yeah, fish://hostname,a nice gui package manager and things will rule.
What's wrong with Synaptic?
how are you doing that?
can u add a .asoundrc file to get software mixing
can you boot off a cd?,can yourpower supply handle another drive ;)


is it possible to get gnome-terminal to use the standard X 7x14 font?
does it show up in the font dialog?
maybe.. don't know its full name tho.. flipping thru the fonts tho.
2.6.8 seems to not be the most stable kernel. i'm having issues with a desktop at work that gets so slow that typing a 4 letter word takes 5 minutes,do the kernel.org kernel's have squashfs? you definitely need that...
are there any mirrors for packages? archive.ubuntu.com seems rather slow for apt-get

hi,I 've just installed Ubuntu on my PC but no I wasn t asked any root password at the installation, so I don t know him ..;
It's disabled,You log in as the user you created during the install and do things with sudo
: okokok,; thanks


hey Mitario... so you are the misterious thresh applet guy, right? :)
yeh :)
afaik ubuntu desktop people were trying to get in touch with you...
yeah, i didn't know they tried so hard :(,some mails where lost on my local harddrive so i'm sorry for that you guys
How can I install something like x2x?  should I use debian repositories ???
edit /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment the 'universe' component,note 'linux' rather than 'kernel'
dooh, sorry,I usually roll my own kernel so haven't had this issue.sorry to say it, but doing what the faq says doesn't work ... : apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` --- is 2.6.8.1-2 not the default kernel?
2.6.8.1-2 is obsolete,if you installed a pre-release, you should read this: https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/WartyWarthogUpgradeNotes
isn't it on by default?,az[a] zel_ubuntu: good to hear. :),az[a] zel_ubuntu: very nice to hear -- so far I'm aware of problems with NForce3 and SATA, but as I don't have that available, I can't check it out.
is this an ubuntu-only bug ?
afaik, no.,it's a kernel problem, it seems.,https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1324


'cos then we can turn on mailman's nntp stuff
you guys have done a fantastic job. congrats
thanks! :-)
dunno if it means anything to you, but i've been a mac user since 87 and this is the first linux distro i feel can be compared to Mac OS in terms of easy of use and polish
heh
know of anyone installing oracle on ubuntu?
not so far,apt-get install ntp-simple,we have a 'no listening services' policy by default,unfortunately, ntp has to
yeah, i was surprised you guys didn't have freetype rendering turned on in firefox by default
dude, let's not do the gnome/kde thing :)
its friendly, i use both.qemu emulating x86 on x86 machine?
yeah,not sure if anyone's done x86 ubuntu on ppc ;)
what project is aiming to move drivers into user space?
there are some gelato project related groups doing it atm.,plus, you already have usb userspace drivers on your system now :)
gelato.org?,found an article on it, thx http://lwn.net/Articles/66829/
there's also some stuff about it in the gelato@UNSW wiki,at which point it doesn't matter to him :),sure,and nothing to do with him :)
here's another project i found http://www.circlemud.org/~jelson/software/fusd/
tried mini-commander? :)
no, i think i looked at screenshots and decided it was too ugly.who do i submit kernel patches to? mdz?
bugzilla or -devel would probably be best,sid (unstable),it's going to get better :-)
i certainly hope so. i'm actually using the fact that ubuntu doesn't ship with ffmpeg as an excuse to learn the gstreamer apis and convert this app at work from ffmpeg to gstreamer
good point.
should i file a bug on nettool missing?
yes please, assign to jeff,i just assigned,you can also just put 'jeff' in the assing to box,and choose between the jeffs if there's more than one
i really like having the icons turned off, i used to take all my icons off my macos desktop also. however, i question the learning curve for new users..did you know that 73.5% of statistics are made up on the spot?
stop making up statistics!
49.8% of statistics are....nevermind
use tseng's repo
got a url for that? google unhelpful
it's been mentioned on -users and -devel
how is the keyboard on the x300, it seemed really hard to use at the sony store
hasn't worried me so far, just forgetting ibook muscle memory
what kind of build setup is that? bunch of opterons?
we have amd64 machines for those,g5 xserves for ppc32 (and hopefully ppc64 next release)
around?.around?.hmm, why isn't it a good idea to install hoary from cd yet?
it won't work very well :),better to upgrade from warty to hoary
bleh, i just want to try it on my amd64 :(,not with this amd64 box, its a monster,btw, i noticed a bug in the installer custom disk partition tool,i selected my sda1 partition and edited it to make it /boot and when it got back to the list of disks, hda1 had been changed instead,i just kept selecting sda1 and changing it and it finally worked, then i told it not to touch hda1,so i guess it worked, but it was a scary bug, haven't checked bugzilla yet....http://elektra.sf.net, any thoughts on that? maybe for grumpy?
the author, and the idea, are entirely scary.
what is scary about the idea besides the amount of work it would take?
it's not necessarily a great idea. the implementation is total crack, too.
i'll admit i haven't looked at the implementation, but the screenshots of all those worthless CDATA blocks are a little scary,i still think the basic concept is a good idea though, as it makes configuration easier, which can't be bad
"easier" doesn't necessarily mean "put it all in the same big mess"
no, but i think "easier" does mean providing a standard for conf files. a standard probably including: API, format, location, tools
different pieces of software have very, very different needs. there's enough evidence of this already (windows registry, gconf, etc).
i agree, but i think what you just said helps the case for some sort of standard, both the windows registry and gconf are standards. the issue being that we've got no standard for lower-level needs. gconf is too heavy for sshd, xorg, etc...
gconf isn't too heavy, it's just inappropriate.,elektra is also inappropraite.
by heavy i mean dependencies: ldd /usr/lib/libgconf.so shows 11 libraries
not a huge issue
for a more universal config API, you'd only want to depend on libc. i agree that this sort of library would be inappropriate for a few applications, but the aim would be to help a majority and looking at the smiliarities in most of the config files in /etc, and $HOME/.*.conf it shouldn't be difficult,it is a huge issue, sshd would never be able to use gconf
dude. it's a dumb idea anyway. i have very low care factor for it. :),read countless mails on xdg about it if you're really interested.


hello,I've just installed ubuntu for the first time - it's great, but...,...how to I change the screen resolution?  the Gnome configuration only offers me 640x480,ok, hang on while I try that...
instead of that, I'd suggest 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86',it's kind of detail overload, just pick the defaults; one of the later screens has a resolution list, and pick the ones you want there,look in /var/log/XFree86.0.log, I bet it'll say that it disabled it,this is probably because autodetection of your monitor's sync and refresh ranges failed for some reason; few modern monitors are limited to 640x480
are usb-keys supposed to be automatic? if so then it doesn't work, if not then all is ok :)
i think they should be
dmesg shows it ok, I *could* just add it myself to fstab, but that's the whole point off automagic
yeah it should definitely auto mount
how do I do that,yes my usb-key shows up in the device manager
so i'm guessing that somehow the message got lost from hal->dbus->gnome-volume-manager
I'll dig around se what I can find,fstab-update.sh is not adding my usb-key to fstab
sorry can't help much without having ubuntu installed
bad boy! :) you should give it a try quite a nice distro
i did, i installed it at work,i use gentoo at home though
hello everyone,some mails where lost on my local harddrive so i'm sorry for that you guys,ah, ok, but still, i'm sorry :),yes i have them,i'm requesting inclusion in gnome-applets atm, so we'll have a better bug tracking system and stuff,i'm going to apply all the patches from ubuntu when trashapplet is in gnome cvs
cool,hoary doesn't exist yet
JStrik1 new draft @ FAQ: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/ | Wiki: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ | Lists: http://lists.ubuntu.com/ | Bugs: http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/ | please test http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~lamont/testing/LiveCD/current/warty-live-i386.iso
completely uninstalled packages will be missing from 'dpkg -l' output anyway, although yours does filter out things like removed packages with configuration files remaining,no, broke too much,boot with 'inotify' kernel argument to try it
:-(,ah great, thanks


correct
imagine there are two sysadmins for a server
it is not about security, really
what about supermount?.what about patching kernel with supermount?
if we don't get feedback now we can't fix things for the final release :)
that's right, but i only note it's not stable and problems are normal
just don't discourage bug reports please :-),I provided directions above for getting to a rescue-style prompt
yes, it would be very helpful,but kernel is with splash image enabled,yes,yes, but it's compiled on kernel, only that,ah, ok, thanks
looks like your popularity has taken the apt mirror down?,*4,your user you setup is ChtiTux,sudo <command>,passwd = first users passwd,i had to edit for my laptop,modelines and such,2 box's and x didn't config right,i'm not complaining people, i know how to edit, chill on me 8),i decided to take gentoo off my laptop after i put ubuntu on one of my desktops i liked it so much :)
yes,that's a bug, it should autodetect,Fabio posted to ubuntu-users recently with instructions on the information he needs to fix bugs like that,please chase that up and file a bug with those details,I know, but we want to fix the autodetection and need help from the people for whom it failed
ok, i need to get on the mailing list.are you part of the devel team?


eek,python-elisp seems to be missing
two months ago I wasn't a python programmer,I concur.
which 2.6.8.1 are you having problems with?
2.6.8.1-3-686
which version?  2.6.8.1-9?,dpkg -l linux-image-`uname -r`,by version, I mean package version,try booting with noapic
okay; I'll be back after fiddling,noapic didn't help, pci=noapic gives an error that it doesn't recognise that argument
<mdz> if not that, pci=noacpi
Oh right,I'll try that now
as long as you're rebooting, might as well try nolapic also
just trying that one,Also; I've noticed that my laptop doesn't powerdown/reboot unless the ac adapter is plugged in,pci=noacpi doesn't help either
I suppose you'll need to file a bug, then.  include dmesg output from 2.6.8.1-9, and also from whichever kernel it last worked with
I'm trying to get 2.6.7 booted so I can check it with that,Okay; it works with 2.6.7-1-686 (2.6.7-2) from debian,I'm rebooting into the warty kernel to record the dmesg from it
I encountered several bugs moving from 2.6.7 to 2.6.8, including my USB breaking horrendously, but they're almost all addressed in 2.6.8.1-9


how would I send in a translation of the Computer menu? many entries there are not translated to swedish    
have you done any translation work before?

wait until they organize the community,i think universe is sid packages recompiled, but i'm not sure
ok
that's mime related
do you know why i can't change it?
no, i'm not in ubuntu now, i'm in sarge
i can right-click and choose open with mplayer
and does it work?,so it can be a bug, don't know,that are Ubuntu Supported
I like the fact that it asks so few questions and only had to reboot once. that beats windows hands-down IMO :-)
: you said that!,: feel free to ask me anything to clarify things.
hey, how do i install divx/xvid codecs into ubuntu?
I installed totem-xine from universe.  With that, you can also drop propietary plugins in.,You need to use totem-xine, instead of the gstreamer backend.
: why must you have a gui frontend?
I don't need one. I want one though.,GUIs are shiny.
hey, how do i install divx/xvid codecs into ubuntu?
you probably want to stick to ffmpeg, which I believe would be included in vlc and xine.
alrighty,cant find the ffmpeg. i did the totem apt-get and it just wont play any divx/xvid :/


hello,I've just installed ubuntu for the first time - it's great, but...,...how to I change the screen resolution?  the Gnome configuration only offers me 640x480
you need to edit /etc/X11/XFree86-r,you need to edit /etc/X11/XFree86-4.what kind of monitor is it?  do you know your v/h rates?
it's a Samtron, fairly old, and its max resolution is 800x600.  Don't have the v/h rates to hand.
what is the model #
it's an SC428-PSL
http://www.monitorworld.com/Monitors/samtron/sc428psl.html
How can I install something like x2x?  should I use debian repositories ???
x2x is in universe
ugh... Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/source/Sources.gz  Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
Try again?  It works for me.
theres mirrors?
?
where is the list of mirrors
do you use any other distros or irc rooms?  name looks familiar
hmm any KDE packages for ubuntu yet?
there are some in universe, but the set isn't complete yet,see the FAQ and /etc/apt/sources.list,http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components/document_view
i could test on bochs if anyone cares,but i would think that is more bochs testing than ubuntu testing,... so..,( bochs being the win98 replacement running overtop of !windows, that is )
quick win4lin vs bochs
: ?, meaning win4lin is faster than bochs?


hmm, anyone have any experience diagnosing laptop/acpi troubles?,I also had to disable pnpbios as parport, ipw2100 and snd-i810audio were fighting over the same IRQ but that seems to be a seperate issue
try booting with : nolapic
ah ok, was that in response to the pnpbios issue or the laptop locking up when lid is closed issue?
i don't understand very well, i'm not native english
when you close the lid of a laptop it presses the button, under windows the laptop starts "sleeping", but with ubuntu the system stops responding
ah, perhaps it works, then
thanks
you're wellcome boy ;).what laptop do you use?
desktop :)
gives a bunch of resolutions,correct freq and no erors,however it didn't give me 1600x1200
`hm.oh?.could you please email the output of 'sudo ddcprobe' to daniel.stone@canonical.com?


is sexy useful?.In the gnome startup sequence.. Does something start for pretty fonts?,gnome apps running under fvwm don't look so hot..Anyone else having ubuntu lock after 10-20 minutes after booting?,I'm think its ACPI on my laptop right now..
what architecture are you on?.try booting with "pci=noacpi noapic" ?,critical ones are, but we're trying to really stabilize warty so we'll actually release on time.
I think that noacpi/noapic worked..
cool. :),used to support my old IBM thinkpad T21 just fine
Better GNOME.,Fedora messes up GNOME in many ways, though.  Absolutely no way to enable menu editing in FC2.  Dumb panel layout by default.  Configuration tools that aren't community supported and not HIGified.
that i agree with
Don't use ubuntu if you like KDE.
isnt that the ppc emulator that they got os x running on?
Yeah.  It runs pretty well.


hmm nolapic seems to fix the laptop locking up when lid is closed,if I don't use pnpbios=off parport seems to claim interrupt 7 and block ip2100 and the alsa sound driver for i810 audio from using it
same here,i filed a bug,https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1322.could you add your info there as well?
have you had time to test your ipw2100 yet?
its an ipw2200, i dont have the 2100 in
I would guess it tries to use EDID (DDC) data, which is often missing on laptops.
but we do rad things to make laptop display detectino work too :)
unfortunately not including detecting APM.
apm is not a display ;)
this machine is rather exotic..,no, just a vital laptop feature.
we have not ceoncentrated very hard on apm; it should work, but we've done more work on acpi
it left this laptop with an X config attempting a depth unsupported by the video chip and ignoring the pointing device completely
let's not do the kde vs. gnome thing guys :)
it does work, when loaded. the installer does not try
or, did not fall back correctly on your machine :),bug reports on that would be really good
hm.it gives you a list of resolutions?,awesome.what happens if you run 'sudo xresprobe dummy'?
hey baby
yo.does not doing chvt at all, help?
no love
ugh. what sort of chipset do you have?,hooray
hmm,my birthday is oct 21
no worries.don't we all?,or if they made a vinyl doll with real bling, like Snoop


and i cant stand the save/open dialogs,the kde/qt ones are much more intuitive,w.e it is i cant stand it,its too simple.does debian/unbuntu use kudzu or a kudzu like system?,i see,im just curious whether it works as good or better than kudzu,i used hotplug briefly when i was with gentoo.does it use its own apt repo, or are the debian apt ones compatible?,eesh
gtk is much easier to skin than kde. just look at the number of gtk/metacity skins compared to kde 3 skins,skinning kde requires writing c++ code, which is insane
all i know is that i can make kde looks sexier than gnome, any day of the week
i doubt it
to me it is
plastik is the only decent kde skin
thats what i use,i think they are both great,each have thier own features


ok,thx,i only asked you since you mentioned it ;),lol, thx
what happens if you run 'sudo ddcprobe' in a terminal?,(is your last line 'edidfail', or do you have a list of resolutions in lines starting with 'timing' or 'ctiming'?),oh, laptop.what sort of video chipset does your laptop use?,we'll have a fix for you :) thanks for the report,hm, we've just backported pretty much the entire nv driver from xorg cvs.could you please run sudo XFree86 :42 -ac -logfile /tmp/xfree86-nv-1680x1050.log -logverbose 999999999 ?,and email the output to daniel.stone@canonical.com, cc'ing fabbione@canonical.com
any other q&a on the cards?,on laptop or desktop
not really -- basically, once we get the nv driver into Warty (expected to happen in a week or such), we can detect your panel properly,um, so yeah, actually don't worry about the log.what happens if you run 'sudo xresprobe nv' on that machine?,(the desktop wit h the crt)
lappy or desktop?
could you please get http://people.no-name-yet.com/~daniels/xresprobe/xresprobe_0.4.8_i386.deb, install it on your desktop with sudo dpkg -i, then /msg me the output of 'sudo ddcprobe | grep dtiming' and 'sudo xresprobe dummy'?,it should work fine for monitor-defined whacky resolutions now :)
no
were and what did you want me to post about my 2 video card configs?
i could test on bochs if anyone cares,but i would think that is more bochs testing than ubuntu testing,... so..
it works well under qemu, but slowly ;)
hey folks.i'm wondering how does one thing work in ubuntu .. plugging my usb key, it appears on the desktop ... what's behind that magic ?
udev, hal, gnome-volume-manager
I will take the fastest path to a support Debian-based distro. =)
:)
supported, rather.
I can only second the recommendation that you donate to daniels,seriously. anything to get us Xorg 6.8 packages faster.
so ubuntu is like sid but security fixes are from ubuntu developers right after the exploit has discovered right? sorry 4 the questions but i'm interesting to use ubuntu as server and i want to update it as soon as possible
that's not really the difference
what do u mean?
ubuntu has six month time based releases based on debian,debian sid
i know that but i want to know if security of ubuntu  is as good as slackware 's


Is Canonical accepting money for support on ubuntu yet?
ubuntu isnt even finished yet,this is a beta period,heh
Yes, but some companies will accept money being thrown at them to get support during a beta period.
make the check out to Daniel Stone,support his drinking habit
do you have test ubuntu packages of xorg somewhere?
no, sorry.you put that in 'Section "Extensions"'?,change Enabled to Enable
ok, now it works, thanks
yes, one which I haven't uploaded yet because my wrists are threatening to implode
ah ok :),dude, take a rest, you guys did a great job :)


oops... "Where is" should read "There is"
I'm afraid not, we haven't got a powerpc live CD yet
Any timeframe for the availability of a live CD?
can't answer that I'm afraid, although if somebody outside the core team wanted to give it a shot they'd be most welcome :),for warty, we'll probably only have i386
alright. And for x86? Where is only one CD image available on the website. I guess it is the installable CD. Is there already a live CD for x86?
the live CD wasn't updated in time for the preview, and wasn't suitable for release at the time; it'll be there for final release
i just installed ubuntu on a dell D600 and it says that there is no wireless devices...even tho it has it built in..anything i need to do so it can find the wireless?
send us the output of 'lspci' and 'lspci -n', and the driver that should be used,oh, if it's an ipw card those won't be detected during the installer yet, it's on our to-do list ...
i am not sure what it is.where should i send my lspci outputs u wanted?,according to lspci it is :  Broadcom Corporation BCM94306 802.11g (rev 03),ah thats got it..thanks.are you familiar with using winmodems?


are you guys throwing up public access to your personal unstable branch?,you can always go gconf diving to turn them back on
during its development cycle, hoary will be public, yah
cool,btw, is suspend in the debian/ubuntu kernel sane?  its been a while since I followed what patch sets debian was using
it should be fine; iirc, we have some acpi patches to fix all that sort of stuff up
on your laptop did you just edit the lid acpi event script?
... my laptop's dead, and when I had one, the lid switch met its death at the hands of a pair of pliers
sed can also do in-place editing with '-i',hrm.is archive.u.c being really slow for anybody else?
I get a delay to open the connection, but a fast download once it's open
weird.
just out of Apache processes, probably
the interesting thing is that pings also take a long time,but the weird thing about it is that even though they take a long time, each packet doesn't take long
I don't get what you mean?
I mean that it takes me ten seconds to get two packets back,But each packet reports that it got there and back in under 100ms,heh.


I had this on every single computer I installed ubuntu to, it just sort of times out or something run again and it is ok
mine works with no changes, hal detected it and pmount mounted it
ok, pmount works, but the gid and uid are 0 whichs means I do not even have ro ???.do you have rw access?,to your usb-key I mean
yes, its mounted as me
funny, more poking ahead then.right I ran pmount as root, now it works, but isn't the whole idea of HAL and friends that I do not have to run pmount at all?
yes, hal calls it for you. hal probably doesn't recognise your key or somehting
but it the most famous of all: El Cheapo! 
el cheapo worked here. run the device manager in computer->system and check out the info
transcend jetflash 2.0,the one from the site installs without compiling in /usr/local
i can also grab the new deb from unstable, but that isn't the point :)
whats a precompiled kernel interface thing.and is it included with ubuntu?,i want to install the official nvidia driver,yeah i have the driver,i tried,it can't find a precompiled kernel interface module or some,thing,right,cool
why not use the ubuntu nvidia-glx?
it doesn't like my dual-dvi card
no, the nvidia-glx, not the xfree86 nv driver.what is your cpu?
thanks very much :)
that should get the nvidia stuff installed.you get the nvidia driver to work?
my monitor wasn't detected properly. should i report this as a bug?
send mail to ubuntu-users first
how do you activate the built-in mode?
open a .py file, or M-x python-mode,apt-get install python-elisp
do you mean pymacs-elisp?
you want pymacs, too, but it's something different :-),it's in universe,you want ~/.Xresources rather than ~/.Xdefaults
hey dude
still here?
your monitor is, um, interesting :),i know how to support it, it just needs some work,where do you find this bizzare hardware? :),why the hell it's reporting custom resolutions of 2288x1430 @ 123Hz is totally beyond me.can it actually do that?
^^^
that monitor inspired the creation of a resolution blacklist


there are mini-cd images, i installed from a 4.4mb iso, that pulled most stuff from the net
where?
i just installed ubuntu on a dell D600 and it says that there is no wireless devices...even tho it has it built in..anything i need to do so it can find the wireless?
does "dmesg | grep ipw" gives you anything ?
I'm content with the fact that menus are used instead of desktop icons, although I think it might be harder for people to find what they need. How about splitting up the Computer menu in two menus, one containing obviously computer related stuff like "System Configuration", "Disks", "Network" (and perhaps Logout and Lock Screen) and then having another menu with more user-oriented items such as Home, Documents, Search for files, etc?
i liked the new menu layout
so ubuntu is like sid but security fixes are from ubuntu developers right after the exploit has discovered right? sorry 4 the questions but i'm interesting to use ubuntu as server and i want to update it as soon as possible
yes.
hey.. i'm on a laptop w/ no cdrom and no floppy.. what options do i have to install ubuntu?
PXE boot?
i'll make it easier for you.. i have a linux distro on here already,no PXE
pxe boot == boting off of ether...ah, okay
er.. YES. .pxe
It is possible to build grub with pxe support, though I have not done it,oh, if you have PXe and another box around you can setup dhcp and tftp...there are HOWTO's around for doing this,I have a laptop with no drives and I've installed it over PXE a number of times,though the initial server setup was a pain
already having a distro on here doesn't give me a head start?
not really....you could fudge an install if you have a spare partition and want to use debootstrap to setup a debian chroot, and then upgrade it with ubuntu sources
can you point me to some howto's
for what, the chroot or the pxe?,hrm, thats spiffy, wasnt aware
well.. i've setup a pxe server before.. w/ knoppix..,so i can handle that.. and i can handle the chroot part
then you need to google around about tftp and pxelinux
what i'm not sure about is the net install w/ ubuntu,why can't i just use the pxe server from knoppix.. worked like a charm for when I setup this install
basically you setup tftp/pxelinux to boot off of the installation image, instead of the knoppix or terminal client image..
ahh.. isn't there a net install or something?,i also have a flash drive that i should be able to make bootable
you have to boot off of *something* to get the net install going,you can try the flash drive, I was never able to get mine to boot
yes.. i have a pendrive,256mb,which should be able to be bootable
if you can get that bootable, then find a netboot floppy image or mini-cd image and go that route
are there ubuntu mini-cd images?
dunno
sweet.. maybe i'll just try to hunt around for a usb cdrom drive or something
well, one route to go....heh...is to find a Best Buy or a place with a solid return policy and get a usb floppy/cdrom, do the install and then return it,In good concious I can't advocate that method, but it...erm...worked for me in the past
<tvon|X31> dat: well, one route to go....heh...is to find a Best Buy or a place with a solid return policy and get a usb floppy/cdrom, do the install and then return it,yeah. that's true


anyone here have any experiences with net-snmp ? ,or know it relativley well ? ,slackware has a good security model ? ,the security of a distribution is only as good as the person running it. ,granted some distributions make it easier to secure but others are simply secure by default.
we made great efforts to proactively improve Warty's security
im sure, but yet again, that all relates to the admin and the choices. 
we removed many suid root bits from programs and now have many daemons run as a normal user which formerly ran as root,of course, an admin can screw up anything, but that's not the point
no matter how secure warty is, if someone chooses to run for example bind or sendmail, no matter how secure the original install was said to be, its all choices :) 
the distro should be secure _by default_, not secure _regardless of root's actions_ :-)
i never disputed it :) 
sure, no thing in the world can stop this
but to say that one distro is more secure than another in a broad sense is a bad thing
I thought this was a question of you about our security model,agreed; this statement can be valid if you append "by default"
no, i was just saying that debian on a whole has a good security model, i cant comment on ubuntu directly because i havent used it, although debian is starting to scare me a bit with the way that it simply doesnt do simple things :) 
which "simple things" in particular? I'm curious
by default when i go for example aptitude install cacti my choice of apache and php are made for me 
yes, these are the default choices of alternative dependencies
and i'm not given the choice, although when i try to install apache2 forcefully and then install php unless i install the correct deb i end up having it wanting to install apache again
but of course you can overwrite them,apache and php are really a tricky issue
of course, but thats a whole lot of effort that other distributions have seem'ed to avoid :) 
it is tricky because you have to depend on a _set_ of mutually exclusive packages
bare in mind im a gentoo user and that `USE="apache2" emerge cacti` would do my trick 
like (apache2 && php4-apache2) or (apache-1.3 && php4-apache1.3),probably we should just get rid of all apache1 stuff ASAP
surely somthing can be done like a deb that asks you "do you want to install apache2 or apache1" ? 
the apache stuff is in fact the only issue known to me where the dependencies go wild
even if its an aptitude update ? ,and vim :P 
not with Debian's current Dependency specification,you have to provide a set of alternatives, and of none is installed, the first one is the default
i suppose
that's in fact the only real good solution: install apache and php before and every apps depending on a webserver will install fine
i don't doubt that, i just think that things could be `smarter`
I'm curious, what does this "brb" mean? I've seen it many times
sed can also do in-place editing with '-i'
didnt know that
sed -e s/foo/bar/ -i ${filename},np


not yet
bugzilla,all canonical people are reachable at firstname.lastname@canonical.com,so jeff.waugh@canonical.com will get to him
well if you and whiprush are around tomorrow i'll give you my asoundrc, and it should work fine
cool,hmm, maybe the mesa changes from ubuntu10,actually, wait, that shouldn't have had any impact
this is a really strange issue, i see a lot of similar stuff searching google, but no one with this exact issue.,oh, and get this. i can run Half-Life 2 with cedega fine.,only having problems with native linux GL games :\
weird.what version was it last working on?
well they've never worked for me, but i see other people posting that they have them running on amd64,and i had quake3 and et running on gentoo,from what i'm reading on google it looks like it could be 1) some exec-shield type thing in the kernel 2) an optimization to Xorg 3) ...still looking for a #3
oh, you need to run in a 32-bit chroot -- are you doing so?
no, but i don't think i should have to. why do you think i need to?,i have all the libraries needed to run quake3 in lib32. i got cedega running Half-Life 2 without a chroot.
i assume the dri modules it loads will be 32-bit,but i dunno, other people have had it working fine, but i don't run amd64 at the time
nvidia drivers don't use dri iirc,the 32bit libs are able to communicate with the 64bit kernel module through /dev/nvidia
hm, true.tried running it under 'linux32'?
no go :\,oh, this is something else i noticed,i can't run ldd on the quake3 binary,but i can run ldd on glxinfo32
google turned this up -- t,i don't know the differences in how they are set up to tell you, but it's entirely possible that gentoo uses a pure 32-bit system, with 64-bit libraries on the side
yeah, that guy doesn't know what he is talking about,i got cedega working fine without 32bit chroot,gentoo is pure 64bit, just like ubuntu.any suggestion on what i should file this bug against? the kernel? xorg? nvidia-glx?
i don't know, probably nvidia-glx
well i opened a bug, thx for the help. https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5646,yeah, he's obviously trolling. i actually wanted to talk to you,i found a sort of half solution to the amd64 nvidia-glx bug i'm having. i know you're busy, but i just updated the bugzilla entry if you're interested,if you've got any ideas i could try them now.
thanks,some form of LCD
do i have to something special for the hal daemon to work? when i try and run the removable storage config, it tells me hald is installed but not running
restart dbus, then hal
will do,finally sussed my no hal start problem, it would have to be the bloody microsoft mouse that does it, heh
huh? bong! :).that's a weird one, can you see what's happening?
it puts an invalid utf-8 string thats a copywrite sign or some such, so hald cant start, this is fixed in hal_0.2.97-0.1_i386.deb in debian testing,since ubuntu is 2.92... i'll gues i'll have to wait or do a little mixing and matching with debian testing
could you file a bug about that? we should fix it :)
no worries man, apart from that little fiasco everything is perfect, this is the distro ive been waiting for ;) youre bluetooth packages rock too, bt dongle and an se t610, works perfectly
sweet
wheres the bugzilla/bts page for ubuntu?
no packages required, however, try this...,dpkg-reconfigure locales,make sure you choose the zh_CN.UTF-8 or whichever you prefer
ok, but i actually use english, i just got some chinese music mp3s and the file names are just ??????.mp3
you'll need to change to a UTF-8 locale,english or chinese, whichever :)
ok, thanks man
utf-8 is love!,in hoary, it will be the default so you don't have to muck around like this :)
perfect, thanks, displaying fine now,i believe you guys are doing it the right way, ubuntu could use a repo like the one christian marillat runs, then you guys are protected, and people can get questionable things they want, everyone is happy, and not being sued, heh,by the way, christians packages seem to work fine with ubuntu (here anyway), so perhaps you needn't bother
and if you are not careful, tollef will zap you.,they're kernel threads,annoying little bug in g-s-m atm :),same as base BUT WITH LESS(1)
LESS(1)?
the less command :)
will the ICEauthority bug/problem, ever have a satisfactory resolution?
which?
when you run k3b, which you must as root, well sudo, when you log out, you cant log in again, until you delete ~/.ICEauthority, or chmod it back to your user
er... BONG,"k3b is not supported in ubuntu" ...
i know, just as many people use it at the moment, due to lack of choice in flexible gnome cd apps, thought maybe it might be looked at, my bad
we can't put any time into it, but perhaps mail -users and see if anyone has seen it and knows a fix
sweet as, there are a couple, but only temporary
for hoary
o.dont suppose youve tried beagle?.do you still do bluetooth packages in your own repo, or are they just in the main repos now?
they're in my repo, but not updated
ok, just ive noticed, and i guess it must be a kernel/bluez.. thing, that when i plug in my usb bt dongle, my box starts working hard out, i can see the temp rise, and hear the fan revving up, but top etc show nothing taxing the cpu,this only happened recently
we're hoping to get it into hoary properly :)
that would be cool,ive been looking at garret's design wiki, beagle is gonna bring some awesome new features to the desktop soon, i'm loving it,him and joe shaw etc seem like some bloody smart guys
file an enhancement request bug or mail ubuntu-devel
ok thanks,to use beagle you need extended attributes set for your fs, they are set for ext3, and now inotify is in the hoary images, no recompiles necessary, but since i use reiser, i still have to recompile, id like it set, unless it could cause grave problems, but i cant see how,are the inotify issues ubuntu specific? or are all distros having similar probs? although beagle is meant to be inotify agnostic these days, it still wont work for me these days
no one's shipping inotify yet
yes i understand its not a production feature, i just meant other development trees, the only other person i noticed having the same problems as me on the dashboard hackers ML, was a fellow ubuntu user, i suppose the others are r love and co though, oh well.will you be attending the linux.conf.au conference in new zealand next year?


hi, i have a weird problem installing Ubuntu on my system, i hope you can help me,i have downloaded the iso, checked the md5sums and they're correct, burned them etc and when i install it, when installing the base packages it barfs of package 'bsdutils' and i have to abort installation,s/of/on.i have tried burning the iso to 4 different cd's so i'm sure it's not the cd... what's going on?,hmm, im not using macosx, i used cdrecord on a debian testing box
corrupt iso maybe?
nope, md5sum matches


is there a reason that http://www.ubuntu.com and http://ubuntu.com don't seem to go anywhere? Shouldn't they be pointing at www.ubuntulinux.org ? 
it's a known problem, being fixed soon :),of course :),yes please,or send an installation report to ubuntu-users.with SATA disks?,try a daily CD build instead :)
jdub/mdz around?
yes
whaddya think?
1333 approved, 1341 you say it's not reproducible?,let's revisit 1341 when the bug has been identified
yeah - working on it now/tonight.,found one path through the code that would produce a null myhostname - requires no networking at install time, AFAI can tell.,should


guess not :( .anyone here be a snmp person ?,*sigh*
roughly, in past gigs.problem?
net-snmpd doesnt seem to trap interface statistics anymore? ,ubuntu install btw. 
not sure, haven't tried thus far ;)
the 'splash' option has no effect on the kernel at all.  perhaps something else is the cause?
may have to do with framebuffer perhaps? i deleted the splash option and it booted
no other changes?
no
and if you add it back, does it oops again?
haven't tried, was too happy having a working desktop :)
I was pretty sure that everything which looked at the splash option had been ripped out; certainly the kernel itself never paid attention to it
i'll try tonight (it's noon here now) and post a report here or anywhere else
sweet, ipod/firewire works okay now
FAT or HFS?
fat. before a few days ago it only worked if it was in when i booted
cool. don't know if you know - but you can use the contacts and calendar bit on an ipod :),i use multisynnc.does 'eject' actually log out of the device? that is, the ipod stops displaying 'do not disconnect'?
yes
that's new...,i think :)
not really, technically its a removable scsi disk. eject /media/ipod
i recall having some troubles with that in past kernels... have a half hack lying around somewhere.... ,but hey - if it's been fixed - rock

might be a bug i saw with sarge, DMA being on shows up bugs in cd drive firmware.  something like hdc=nodma might help (check the option though)
hdc=nodma passed to kernel at boot time?
yeah,ubuntu kernel,under computer,sounds like you have not got the panel menu applet added
whats it called?
you probably don't have the menu panel applet added
what applet


does anyone know if future versions of ubuntu will give you an option of installing lilo?,I like lilo,been using it forever,now I have to learn all the grub stuff,why is grub better? I'm not arguing, I just want to educate myself,ah ok,I'll read some more documentation and stuff
it should just work[tm] 
I like to fiddle


is apt-get ready to use in default instalation... i did apt-get install samba and is stucked
the servers are a bit loaded right now; give it a minute,apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`.it should be automatically loaded by hotplug. what kind of sound card?.lsmod | grep snd shows no sound drivers loaded?,another possibility is that your system has a second sound device, and the wrong one is found first
when i open totem says: Device /dev/dsp does not exist
aha,so snd-pcm-oss isn't getting loaded.a long shot, but could you check for /etc/modprobe.conf?
i don't have modprobe.conf
ok, good.and you installed from the preview CD?,try this:,log out of gnome, and on the text console, modprobe -r snd-intel8x0 snd-intel8x0m snd-pcm,then modprobe -v snd-intel8x0m
 ok lemmie check,u there


does anyone know if future versions of ubuntu will give you an option of installing lilo?
extremely unlikely.why?
I like lilo,been using it forever,now I have to learn all the grub stuff
I liked lilo to until I used grub :)
why is grub better? I'm not arguing, I just want to educate myself
grub knows about the filesystem,if you screw it up,and get the wrong file,it'll still boot,if you recompile the kernel,and name it the same,it'll still work
ah ok,I'll read some more documentation and stuff,I like to fiddle


rock on the ubuntu release - impressed
sweet, thanks,see the faq :).how often can you see the icons on your desktop when you're doing Real Work?
wow... a FAQ with a question of mine answered... this is... new... strange... :),depends... X apps tend to like to position themselves over the icons.. which is annoying - MacOS style of having apps not put themselves over the icons is quite nice
lots of screen space wasted, etc.
rock the sudo and not root thing though.
he's already doing that, had a different idea
ahh....gather there's some way to get a stack of CDs for the LUV crowd?
shipit.ubuntulinux.org...
so not ready for the ubuntu talk?
no,but i'll have ISOs of a recent daily with me
cool - number of ppl have already been playing - but there's interest, so a bunch of CDs on the night could do quite well.,Markrian : remember all the work apple put into UI stuff, especially around the development of the mac
yeah, i started regularly using it then too
same. i actually have icons for folders on the desktop and everything.,and i use the desktop now in exactly the same way I did in the macos days. like i do my real desk... a place for mess.,and Keynote. that is a killer app
keynote is not a huge leap from other presentation tools
i found that going from PPT/OOImpress to it was like reaching Nirvana - i was no longer fighting to get slides done.
yeah, it's a better mousetrap, not a new way of looking at things. :)
does ubuntu come with an "internet connecting tool which can handle an usb-dsl-modem"?
here we need eagle-usb for this
i'll forward you an email i got about someone asking for this


anyone have any luck installing ndiswrapper on ubuntu?
somebody from canonical was working on it AFAIK, dunno if it's getting integrated
i am trying to build it right now but it keeps saying it cant find the kernel sources,it told me to link build to /usr/src/linux-x.x.x and i did that..but still the same error


if it's G you'll probably need the wrappers,'lo,has anyone else noticed/cared that lilo isn't in warty?  I kind don't like grub
do you really see grub for that long? it is a lot better and all...
need some help configuring x :( "can't find screen",I thought ubuntu was going to work right away...,i guess no one can help here
file a bug with the output (as root) of ddcprobe and xresprobe <driver> (where driver is the driver for your card)
'night thom
about?
what ?,glib's function
#1299 is caused by that...
I'm using devhelp to browse the API, very handy
if I force things happy in the one place that xchat does that, then we die in pallette.c in some shared lib....
?,just use g_utf8_validate () and according to the result g_locale_to_utf8 () or not
it's not in xchat... it's in some shlib somewhere..,nm looking..
is your system an update from woody, or a clean install?
clean install
does it show up as /dev/usb/xxx or /dev/xxx?
/dev/sda mounted on /media/usb-key (called by: pmount /dev/sda usb-key)
is mono in universe?


hey people - i am having a problem trying to get the glider theme looking good.anyone got the same problem?,the buttons look majorly square and boring.how do i install that?
why don't you take a screenshot for us
thats what i got - still working on the screenshot


just hope he does not suggest to rename it to 'gnubuntu'
that'd be a great name for an Ubuntu derivative focused on free-software only though :p
yeah. Or we could name it something else... like "Debian" :P
Debian contains non-free software </rms>
that post implies that ubuntu is a snapshot of sid at the point of release.when do you guys freeze the upstream stuff for != GNOME?


(yet)
I cant run the device manager, it flickers up for a second then goes, any ideas?
hal isn't running? run it in a terminal
thats what i thought to do initially, but it makes no difference
check hald is runinng and not dead
no not running, even though a '/etc/init.d/hal start' produces an [ ok ] , im confused, heh
please file a bug about the eject issue if there is not already one in bugzilla
I have a bug about other problems with apple keys at debian's bts.is the current Ubuntu easy to install under UML?
ubuntu is just as easy to install under UML as Debian
I know how to do it with debootstrap, I'm trying to install it from the installer
I did some work months ago to make d-i play nicely with UML, but I didn't keep up with their development and it stopped working again at some point


hey people - i am having a problem trying to get the glider theme looking good.anyone got the same problem?,the buttons look majorly square and boring
you need to install the smooth engine.have you modified your /etc/apt/sources.list at all?
nope


should i?,i am a fresh-outta-the-box debian newbie
try apt-get update,then apt-get dist-upgrade,those comands bring your system completely up to date,yes,we hope to make that even easier... when a new release comes out, upgrading warty will ask you if you want to move to the newer release
would windows be so successful if it was MS/WIN5.10 ?,i doubt it,heh,the installer dislikes my dual dvi card, if anyone cares
what happened?
X fails to find any displays,i presume that its looking for analouge ones,i have an xfx nvidia 6800GT dual dvi


yeah.
does it do that when the big battery is being displayed as well?
and changes colour the same way the big battery image does,it always does it (making it conditional would have been a bit more work)
hrm, that'd look pretty sucky :(  might as well just disable the big image if the little one drains and changes colour,that thing always took up too much space anyway,though the little image doesn't show you how charged the battery is when charging :-/
the defaults are set to not show the big image,so on a clean account it should be compact and useful.
yeah, I'm just thinking when people change the defaults ... it shouldn't be not-useful/ugly for them
hopefully the battery applet will get a fair bit of attention in the Gnome 2.10 release cycle.  The current code is pretty evil.,I could imagine showing a small bar next to the power cord to show the charge while on A/C


but a bunch of random stuff too,heh.is there a good tutorial on developing gtk2/gtk/metacity/icon (theme/GUI) related stuff ?
http://ajgenius.us/
your site ?
nope,there's a hidden wiki btw. http://www.ajgenius.us/gnome/Themes/Tutorials/ this one should have more info
what about gnome coding in general , and user interface design


but a bunch of random stuff too,heh.is there a good tutorial on developing gtk2/gtk/metacity/icon (theme/GUI) related stuff ?,yeah Im loving ubuntu, works out of the box for the most part,and the problems have been pretty minor,webwiz: what soundcard , wifi card .. are the supported under a different dist of linux
exactly.
meaning do it yourself , its pretty minor compared to some of the other bugs


hrm, i might have to kill and reload it :)
it provides useful battery charge status even when the big battery image is disabled..is that the only spanish you know?
no,but it is the only spanish i know that approaches usefulness as a sentence
is that for the case of no local printers?
should work with local printers too
so you give the user direct access to the parallel port or USB device?
uhm, i tried installing with nodma for the cd drive but it still borks, now i reinstalled sarge and tried to burn the iso again and cdrecord crashed :/,looks like i have no way to try this stuff out.hi, i just finished installing but base-config didnt ask me for the root password (either that or i'm too tired and i didnt spot it / did something wrong), thing is i cant login as root now, what can i do?,but sudo asks me for the password
your password, not root's,sudo is as secure as su, some suggest more-so because you don't need a shared root password that can be "found out".  And the user created during install is the only one given sudo access by default, and they're the one that generally sets the root password anymore,under Computer,it should be the menu on the panel next to Applications.what do you have?  Applications + Actions ?.did you upgrade a machine from Debian rather than freshly install?
nope, but i have a pretty ancient $HOME with config files dating back from gnome 1.x and several migrations,so sure there are some conflicting config options and stuff


martink!,az[a] zel_ubuntu: no, but next release, for sure. :-),oh, for samba, possibly,:-)
will you use samba for this purpose or the news Webdav backend of alex ?
we'll wait and see :).with gvm?.how so?
like conciderieng my device (eg. my phone) as a volume, in wich i could copy/paste/create files,funny business to ship at its own .gpdf uses pango ?
install totem-xine from universe


I was just going to ask when gpdf has to be perfect to get into hoary
dude,sorry :),i grumbled a bit about this one ;),most of the pdf support issues were sorted by the time 2.8 came out, save for the type3 fonts thing (right?),and there were comments about no text search.how is the preview-style integration going? reckon that's going to happen for 2.10?
fonts: yes type3 (and a corner case with not embedded fonts),preview integration: this time we might actually produce some code
that's going to rock *so* *hard*,;),;)
and I didn't blame the terminal for the delay


I did that ,it installed smooth , but I dont see it as an option ,in 'themes',oh,what themes use it,what does it do exactly 
: you can install all sid's available gtk-engines,: which add quite a nice look and feel, plus extra thems also from sid's repository,: just add the "universe" keyword to the apt sources list,
already did
: and apt-get install <whatever>
what are the package prefixes so I can just use a wildcard ,Besides gtk-engines , which I already did
: sec
gtk2* is one , gtk-engines is one too
: gnome-themes, gnome-themes-extras 
apt-get install gtk2* , apt-get install gtk-engines* installs a TON of 1.x 2.x themes
: i happen to like them very much, i usually switch them alot,: plus because theme installation in gnome is no easy, you can do it "manually" from the gnome looks website
which one do you have?
ibook g4
I have the same problem with my powerbook,switch to a text terminal (outside X),and execute: showkey (it exits after 10 seconds without pressing any key)
ok
and press the eject key,hmmm
I get 0x80 0x81 0xa1 0x80 0x81 0xa1
like I
that sucks
I didn't found any fix for it, sorry
I gotta get home to my wife,I'll talk to you guys tomorrow,other than a few quirks, ubuntu rawks
xev sees it as Super_R key,later


please _dont_ run pmount as root, that makes no sense
yes *now* I know :)
I'm currently hacking at pmount, maybe I should just stop if it is called by root
how can I limit my updates to security updates only?
just comment the main/restricted/universe deb lines in /etc/apt/sources.list and just keep the security deb line,but then you cannot install new software any more,after warty's release in October, you will only get security updates anyway
but is it possible to run updates from one repository only, without removing the other ones?
no easy way that I know of,I would write a small script which changes apt sources temporarily, does the upgrade and changes back the sources
I wrote this small script that does just that but it feels kind off funny
there might be an easier way, though:,you can run apt-get -c /etc/apt/update.conf upgrade,create /etc/apt/update.conf which points to a different source list,this is entry Dir::Etc::SourceList,man apt-get says it all
thanks, reading now
option -c is the one you look for
I installed your Utopia-stuff, and it did not blow up my computer
nice to hear! It blowed cd burning for mdz...
ah, I haven't tried that yet, I'll try, if I suddenly dissapear ...
didn't I write that the new nautilus-cd-burner slurps your hand into the CD drive? :-)
aaagh, typing with one handdfgbsd dfasdfsaf
Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete is not _that_ easy with just one hand, is it :-)
sorry to dissapoint you but it all worked flawlessly, no slurping, no nothing
damn, debian/patches/slurp_user.diff does not seem to work,nice to hear!
i put in empty cdrw, dropped stuff in it, and burned it
what about USB devices?.or putting in a CD?
plugged it in ....???? it opens two windows sdb and sdb1 ???
but if sdb1 is a partition, sdb should not contain anything?
let me check the partition-table,I mught have messed that one up,table looks ok ... /dev/sdb1               1        1015      255752   83  Linux
I will return to that later; just have to provide a quick fix for cd-burner
ok, two is better then zero ;-)
but the sdb window _is_ empty, yes?
yes, but I'll try to drop stuff in sdb1 and then see what happens,hmm it looks hosed, I can drop in both drives, if i unplug without unmounting it doesn't write, sync is turned of or something
what does "mount" say? For the options?
/dev/sdb1 on /media/sdb1 type vfat (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,sync,uid=1000,gid=1000)
looks good,sdb should not be there.can you please look in the device manager? if sdb has block.is_volume and block.device?
and it doesn't sync straight away
but the mount flag is set; I cannot do anything other than that,you need to install package hal-device-manager,it now has a package on its own,no, the old hal package contained it
ok, it pulled it from your drive.block.is_volume is set to one one both ??? why?
damn new hal...,sdb should not be a volume,can you please mail me the full output of lshal? martin.pitt@canonical.com
it's good you do this for a living ... at last somebody to complain to :)
:-),such regressions are the reason why I'm actually hesitant to upload new upstream versions,if I see something that tells apart sdb from sdb1, I can fix this
yes better one guineapig
?.what has this to do with guinea pigs?,I looked at the lshal output; there seems to be absolutely nothing that tells sdb and sdb1 apart.IIRC you formerly did not have a partition on the stick, is that right?,so maybe it does not have a proper MBR, but still has a VFAT signature on the first block
i made the partition by hand, should i format the disk in XP, then i have a really funly partition-table
it should be sufficient to put a proper MBR onto it; then you can even boot off it
how?
apt-get install mbr,install-mbr /dev/sdb
never seen it (mbr), i'll try, brb
ah, you have to say /sbin/install-mbr /dev/sdb (it's not in user's path)
that fixed it
hmm. This could be regarded as a bug; hal seems to look only at the first block to identify a file system,usually this should be enough, though,I don't think that I can fix that for Warty, but I will tell upstream about this
i can't umount anymore
what? sdb/sdb1/nothing?
but it isn't busy,it is lying
it is busy
bad, bad disk
gnome-volume-manager keeps some locks and the trash on it,you need to unmount with the desktop or disk icon,btw, please no sudo umount; use pumount /dev/sdb1 for this
same error
pumount -l /dev/sdb1,wait
same error
you could do lsof | grep sdb1 before,to see what's actually wrong,or just rip it out; hal will handle that correctly
tried that, no output,I know I can rip it out, but yesterday I could unmount it 
normally this should be possible..did you unmount it before you installed the mbr?,modifying the raw device while it is mounted always requires a reboot (which is a unplug/replug for usb)
pulled it out, put it back in, same error :( ,it's no biggie, it works but well ...
so now only sdb1 window appears, but you can't unmount it, right?
and it doesn't sync,yes only sdb1 but i can't write to it
but it is mounted with sync
use the mouse mat, it will ease the pain
not mine, it is flat and hard,so you have a readonly, non-syncing, busy stick .
if it helps I'll yell at my usb-key for you ...
I hope that the mbr writing did not damage the partition map/the file system,do that, please
i'll try in XP
you can reformat it if you want,I can tell you how
it works in  .... windows ...
that is odd. Can you erase, repartition and reformat the stick?,I can't think of anything what should keep linux from writing onto a VFAT drive.but the mount options are obviously correct, yes?,looks perfect
almost perfect, but the devil is in the details ...
do you have any particular "devil" in mind? (i. e. a cause for the troubles)
yes, it doesn't *sync* when i type sync and then unplug then it is ok :(,sync-devil that would be
do you have another device to test this stuff? Does it happen there, too?
i tried my usb-zip-drive and goes how many windows it opened ...
0?
*TWO* :-) :-)
also the raw device?,okay, this starts to suck.,I already asked upstream, I will try to find a fix myself,BTW, I know what could have went wrong
sda and sda1 and I can't umount it, and the disk doesn't eject either, and I will not climb behind my computer to yank the cable ...
it mounted your raw device, which means that as soon as you write onto a mounted (nonexisting) /dev/sdb file system, it will overwrite /dev/sda1!,please reboot your computer to sort that out,I will try to find a fix for not mounting the raw device,brb, have to reboot quickly
i'll wait with writing to the devices, but it kind of leaves something to be desired.
I just created a file system on my raw usb stick, without partitions. Nice to see that this works now with the new hal,I can reproduce the error,now I can start hacking :-)
suffering is always nicer together with somebody else, good luck
it is still nice that you discovered this before I uploaded the packages,good to have some selected victims^Wtest users before the official rollout :-)
my pleasure,it's good to give something back to what seems to become a *really* neat distro
I agree. In fact warty is already the best distro for powerpc,on i386 it's still not as smooth as SuSE or Mandrake, but I think we get closer...
even if warty doesn't get it completely right, well it is only the first one, suse it at 9.1
that's right.
but you should be hacking not chatting :-) , so I'll shut up now, and get back to work
OTOH, it will take us 5 years to reach 9.x :-),I can do multitasking. I let hal package build while I irc :-)
what do you use to make your own repository?
arch?.or deb?
deb
apt-ftparchive sources . | gzip > Sources.gz,same for s/sources/packages/
ok,dinertime, happy hackin' !
it's not even lunch here :-),it's time for reboot here, my hal has crashed heavily
any news on the hal-front?
unfortunately not, this is pretty complicated,I'm working on it
no hurry it works if I sync by hand
nevertheless the raw device must not be mounted; this will screw up your stick
I just rebooted and I can unmount my zip-drive now
good to hear; I did some other things in the meantime, I need some more time to fix hal
to make things more confusing, now it works ok
I prepared my USB stick exactly like you did, I can reproduce it
ok, btw my zip-drive is mounted on my desktop as a disk not as a zip-drive (wrong icon)
can you please file a bug about this?
sure, but first diner!,i added one more hal-bug (minor) https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1866,hal seems to be workig ok now
wrt the gphoto camera?
i was more woriedabout drives mounting as sda and sda1
ah yes, that should be fixed, too
it seems to be ok now, now /dev/dsp is malfunctioning
please don't tell me that this is hal's fault 
:) no no , you're the man! hal is fine
but what's wrong with the sound?
rhytmbox doesn't work, but totem does
hmm, rhythmbox works fine for me,too. I use it every day as my main source of noise :-),does it say that the device is busy? 
and i still ahve the bonobo problem,/dev/dsp: No such device,ls -l /dev/dsp -> crw-rw-rw-    1 root     audio     14,   3 Sep 30 12:56 /dev/dsp,it's just weird as the sound works, i'm listening to music right now through totem
looks pretty normal, except for the permissoins.can you close totem and open rhythmbox? may be "not exists" is a wrong error for "is busy"?
i changed it with chmod a+rw, but that didn't help
that's good, I already thought that udev messed up the permissions,as long as you are in group 'audio' you can access the device
rhytmbox says cannot open device for writing, in the terminal it says no such device.how can I see what audiodevice totem uses?
try 'lsof | grep totem'
/dev/dsp1
does that exist?
/dev/dsp1 ... yes,i *do* have mplayer stuf installed.is it possible /dev/dsp is my tv-card or something?
could very well be; I even heard reports that it was the modem,it's not the source that matters, you have to change the sink
rhytmbox now works ok
already saw it,but this should work better, in any way
well it's still beta,why does hal-device-manager dissapear all the time I installed three times already and i never removed it
three times?,it should have only been vanished when upgrading to the hal 0.2.98 package,the deviec manager now has its own package,since it is not really required to run hal, its only a debugging tool
with install, omce when we where debugging and today, but maybe i mix up compuetrs
ping
pong (with a very faint echo)
#1866 is still valid?.if so, which type of ZIP drive you have (usb/parallel/ide)?
i have a usb zip-drive, i haven't used it for a while though, you want me to test it? on hoary or warty?
well, we know that it does not work on warty, so hoary :-),the new hal version contains a patch, but only for IDE zip drives,it would be nice to check whether usb zip still does not work
i have both ide-zip and usb-zip i'll test both and let you know somewhere at the end of next week
nice, thanks! Please write your results in the bug report
do you know how to restore the partition table to a usb-key, i get an error when plugging it in and it can no longer be accessed (not on windows, nor on linux) fdisk says: unable to open dev/sda
hmm, fdisk should not care about the partition table.sure that you do this with sudo?
sudo fdisk /dev/sda gives: Unable to open /dev/sda
but /dev/sda does exist?.does "dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1k count=10" work?
dmesg says: usb 3-2: device descriptor read/64, error -71
no idea. sounds like a hardware problem...
dd: opening `/dev/sda': No such file or directory
dmesg output is from plugging in?
it is a lot, i don't want to flood the channel
uhm, i tried installing with nodma for the cd drive but it still borks, now i reinstalled sarge and tried to burn the iso again and cdrecord crashed :/,looks like i have no way to try this stuff out.hi, i just finished installing but base-config didnt ask me for the root password (either that or i'm too tired and i didnt spot it / did something wrong), thing is i cant login as root now, what can i do?,but sudo asks me for the password,ah,sec,oh, it works.but isnt that like, insecure?.or am i supposed to disable it in sudoers later?
no, the initial user generally is the person with physical access so has root anyway,you can of course disable it if this isn't true
it isnt cause i created a foo user first (because my files in my $HOME partition have uid 1001 so i want them to match my real user when i create it)
hm, not familiar with that case, again I'd suggest reporting a bug so I can look at it
will do.where's ubuntu's bugzilla or whatever?
the URL's in the topic
what component should i file under? debian-installer? grub-installer?
grub-installer,(although debian-installer is an acceptable catch-all for installer stuff)
done, #1527 commited to bugzilla, ask if you need any extra info
that map bug does make sense to me, but I'll have to read up a bit to find out if there are any otherwise unexpected side-effects
sure, i'd be interested to know, but it just works for me... windows thinks it's in C:\ and everything is fine so far (have been doing this for months now)
I guess the main issue might be somebody who has a Windows install that's happy in D:\; I was under the impression that that was possible, if fiddly,that said, I haven't actually used Windows since 95
i just play command&conquer ;),the D:\ thing might be an issue, you're right, but i dunno either,btw, regarding the grub map thing, i found this: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grub/2003-04/msg00019.html -- you might want to have a look


it should've installed the smooth engine already
it doesn't, it's a bug
Is ubuntu a debian based distro ?
yes
any one here on ppc? I can't seem to burn the .iso image. I keeps kiling disk utility. (I'm trying to use a cd rw)
it's a bug in disk utility :-/
I've heard he's an interesting chap
hey
hello


any one here on ppc? I can't seem to burn the .iso image. I keeps kiling disk utility. (I'm trying to use a cd rw)
known bug with the Mac OS X burner program
is there an alternative CLI proggy?


just a simple question... does Ubuntu use a dedicated apt-source repository or the official debian sources?,tnx Kosai !,no way to install k3b so? :-)
add universe to your sources, and install
i have problems with totem too. can't get video display, only sound.
Humm, I have not tested video display. I'm gonna try.
how do I get into gstreamer-properties?
On a terminal, write gstreamer-properties,Or on the execute program window.
Ahh, I think I figured out what the problem was... I had added universe to my sources,I'm curious because I can't seem to sleep/suspend,when I echo 1 to /proc/acpi/sleep I get a message saying that it can't suspend some device,and I was wondering if it was a kernel thing
do you have a BIOS hotkey for suspend ?
I don't think so, I'm not sure... 
make-kpkg && dpkg -i ../linux-... .deb
thanks, I think that answers my question.I assume the make-kpkg does all the initrd stuff for me?
yes
I did the make-kpkg, but I don't see a linux debian package


for the video, shouldn't you configure it with gstreamer-properties ?
Could be. :).But that's for nerds, isn't it?
my xv doesn't work either,actually totem doesn't display anything in x11 mode either
What xvinfo says you?
but realplay does work with x11 mode
I think it's totem fault.
which part?,i should try with just gstreamer player.which part of xvinfo's output should i look at?
Well, if you got some output and not "No Xv extensions" it's fine.
so xv should work?
Yes.
so the latest is 2.6.7?,strange, the only image I see is 2.6.7
apt-cache search linux-image-2.6,http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/warty-changes,normal bugzilla.and yours?,ok
yes
res?
1920x1200,sure thing,The labels are okay, but the place where you type in the name uses small fonts,75x75 dots per inch
do you believe that? :)
ummm, is that a trick question? ;-)
do you really believe that your screen is 75dpi at that resolution? :)
never thought about it
is it 25x16 inches? :)
for a 15" widescreen to be at 1920x1200....is there a way to fix that?
you can set it in your x configuration; for some reason X can't determine it from the monitor
so is it a configuration-specific problem?,wow!  Fixed the screen size made a world of difference.should 75x75 be fixed by maybe asking the user what size screen it is (15", 17", etc) if it can't tell what the dpi is?


jre 1.50rc works fine with mozilla-firefox in Ubuntu
unless you're running amd64 probably ;)
Hi to all/Hola a todos,One hour running Ubuntu,I am a happy man,I was running Guadalinex for amonth and I was quiet happy,but packages were foe sid
i don't like guadalinex way of development,but that's inherent of debian, not guadalinex,guadalinex has a big problem with security updates in future,it's the same, it's componentized linux from progeny,nor even in debian,there's no synaptic related, it's not in repositories, as i know.btdownloadgui doesn't work?.what library?,try this,edit your sources,only enable the repositories you need,you're wellcome,y cuida la flauta
Do you know how often packets are updated in Universe?
when it will be stable, i think 6 months,devel it's sid, more less,ubuntu ALWAYS is being based in sid,and badopi.are you bulmero?,i'm trukulo, i was on distribution list, and know i'm in badopi, in barcelona
I will be at BCN on friday, work meeting, you will feel my Ubuntu there :D,I am a lawyer working fo a firm in the Diagonal, I work in the Palma Ofiice and regularly we report to the branch in BCN,Will be great, as the clients let me go.... :D
umm, that's difficult :P
Sure I will love it,difficult because you know now I am a lawyer and don't want your good name wasted? :D
i'm used to lawyers, do you know javier de la cueva?
I am a happy man,I was running Guadalinex for amonth and I was quiet happy,but packages were foe sid,What I like of guadalinex is that after trying other distros I do love debian and apt get,so Guadalinex had a good repository,I kniow, but guadalinex was my 1st Debian,did not know,Also I got a copy of Linex 2004,but I will keep with Ubuntu.Do some of you use Azureus? Can someone help me installing JRE?
There's a good Java-on-Debian guide here, if that helps: http://wiki.osuosl.org/display/DEV/Java+on+Debian
the prob comes that in the repository of Ubuntu theer is n JRE,thx ggi,I thought, maybe I am mistake that I used Synatyc,thx it looks great
It definetly works with Debian, though I haven't tried it with Ubuntu yet. I'm doing so.
I want JRE for azureus, anyway from Sinaptyc I installed the bittorrent app, it's great but the gui does not work and I must use btdownloadcurses, whichI don't understand as easy as a gui,thx azeem, trukulo I have a problem with a Python Lybrary
The required library isn't a dependency, it's a in suggests or recommends, I forget.
I will check and tel you,just a sec
I thought as much. Apt-get install this: libwxgtk2.4-python
that one ggi,ggi.sorry ggi from my command line I try apt-get?,Oh god sorry sudo, I forget
Yeah. What trukulo said.
pu,pu,pu.. no, sorry, apt-get can not find it, will try with 2.3,I think the problem is in my repository
It's in universe.
so automatically must work with a command of apt-get?,thx trukulo.trukulo/ggi If I enable Universe, is better that I uncheck the other sources?
Yeah. Comment them out.
ggi/trukulo thx now downloading,bye trukulo/buenas noches,:D,yeah it works,:hugs with humanity ggi
Grand. I'll tell you if I get Java working with that guide. It's going well.
well good night from Spain, see you all tomorrow


haggai_ is an OOo debian maint. And I hack OOo sometimes...,ah, you already found the right channel
yes, tried each of   {oftc,opn}/#openoffice{,.org}  before getting the right one :)
there's also #debian-oo for debian specific ooo questions
it's not Debian specific, but if the clue/response level is likely to be higher, I'll give it a go?
not with this question, I'm afraid.it's very likely that all the res files contain the same data for toolbar icons. Did you try bzip2ing all res files in one archive?


hi, I have a question about LVM support on powerpc,I tried d-i RC1 on i386 machine with root on LVM,and it worked fine,yesterday I tried ubuntu 4.10 preview,and I couldn't have LVM work,not sure about ubuntu
it's included by default
how could I set a partition as a volume group?,I didn't remember how I did it last time
not really sure, but LVM setup is included in the installer
thanks, i think i'll try again
see the second email
flash... what a pain... macromedia needs to open source the viewer
Help open source projects implementing SWF standard.,Depending on Macromedia's binary is not a solution.,Take a look at http://swfdec.sf.net/ and http://gplflash.sf.net/ .
are those still in active development?  Last I tried them they weren't very accurate
I found swfdec to be adequate for *my* purposes.,Yes swfdec is active, and gplflash was once discontinued but they released fix in 2004.,swfdec cooperates with GStreamer (to-be-freedesktop.org-supported media framework)
swfdec hasn't released an update in almost a year and a half if you go by their website
Well, but it's still active. :-),Help them integrating ActionScript compiler from Ming project.,Ming is PHP Flash generator, that has about the best open source ActionScript implementation.,Even if they aren't active, relying on propreitary binary is *not* a solution.
you'll get no arguments from me there.  the pain is that flash is so ubiquitous now,we need a decent standard that browsers will include by default
And Macromedia's is not a solution, so only solution is to help open-source Flash projects...,Yes it is a pain.,At least Flash is not software-patented. Thanks for that. :(
hi, I have a question about LVM support on powerpc,I tried d-i RC1 on i386 machine with root on LVM,and it worked fine,yesterday I tried ubuntu 4.10 preview,and I couldn't have LVM work,not sure about ubuntu
sorry, there's an issue with parted on powerpc which means that LVM isn't currently supported on powerpc
aha, that explains things well
I spent some time debugging it at debconf4, it's not trivial to fix :-/
so even d-i powerpc doesn't support LVM?
nope
I see, thanks for the info..is there any bug number that I can watch on this issue?
don't know of one
need me to file one? :-)
only if you really want to, it's unlikely to make things happen any faster :)
I won't bother then.  thanks.


file a bug in bugzilla, please - bug reports on IRC get lost really easily, and a permanent record makes it much more likely we won't forget
great distro by the way..very smooth
ta :),it depends on your laptop,there's a place you can put options that doesn't get overwritten when update-grub is called
you guys going to include ndiswrapper at all?
we already have
in the current or in the next release?
it's already in warty,it's part of our standard kernel images as of linux-source-2.6.8.1 2.6.8.1-7,it's not on the CD, so no
are all these fixes updated when u do and update via apt-get?
not installer fixes, no, but if you've already installed then presumably you don't care,yes,don't believe so ...
when are you guys release the RC?
sometime today,python-dev, probably


ubuntu doesn't work on my SATA system... which kinda lame as debian does :\
define doesn't work?
try apt-get install build-essential,that was the name, I think
thanks again. it worked :)
ubuntu doesn't work on my SATA system... which kinda lame as debian does :\,i looks like someone modified ubuntu's d-i in a way that broke it for this particular system
more likely it was fixed in debian and hasn't yet been fixed in ubuntu
does ubuntu use kernel 2.6 ?
yes.what kind of keyboard?
just a cheap PS/2 keyboard


Hm.
judging from Daniel Stone's periodic "aargh" screams about resolution detection, I don't think it's that simple unfortunately
Unfortunately. But it should be simple. :(,#debian is quite useful, AFAICT.
not IME
Why? Quite some bugs were discovered by redirecting newbie installing Debian to #debian-boot, I think.,Mailing lists are more useful than IRC channel in general.
we (i.e. #debian-boot developers) would far rather they be directed to the mailing list; we need the IRC channel to be kept reasonably quiet so we can get on with development there,bug reports on IRC aren't such a good idea, as a general rule ... they get lost too easily
will packages from Ubuntu install fine on Debian?
unlikely,they're all handled by the one driver ;)
still


could anyone confirm me wether I can use an adaptec 3200s raid card with stock ubuntu?
should be able to
does it come with the stock binary kernels? (because it's a patch that has to be used, it's not in the kernel by default)
oh, hrm, in that case, i'm not sure
but what if you minimize a window?
i don't :-),you can install it from universe, yes,nautilus will do that for you :-),tseng has a repo of updated mono stuff,we may include mono in our next release,not in this release -> but hoary will have a cool userland splash thingy :)
I was a bit confused during the Ubuntu intall.,IF you don't select to download things from the internet, do you not get X, Gnome, etc.It said there were 500 and some odd packages, were the majority sitting around in some temporary cache on the HD?
robertj: 
apt-get -s install foo.will show you the actions, but not carry them out - is that what you mean?
thank,yes,so i can see what deps it will install
is there going to be an "official" way of adding a mount point, for a usb drive or similar?
mount points should not be exposed to users,but perhaps if you specify it in /etc/fstab, project utopia will leave it alone,then perhaps hal is not running,try opening the 'Removal Storage' capplet
could you tell me the sequence that's supposed to happen when I plug in a new usb storage thing, or maybe more useful, this was happens when I try:,running g-v-m in a terminal, it tells me that it can't mount (bas superblock or too many mount fs), but it doesn't create any new mount point that I can see,mount (as root) straight to /mnt, works fine, and then surprisingly opens up in nautilus
sorry, I can't help you further. I don't really know what Canonical did with the project utopia stack
i have a SD card from my camera that i want to mount at /media/camera instead of /media/sdc1.i tried a line in /etc/fstab but it stopped it from automounting - any ideas?,sudo schmudo - any ideas on my mount problem :),but then i will still have sdc1 show up in my /media dir
why do you want to mount it somewhere else?,in general, we shouldn't worry about where stuff is mounted, it should just work
wow, is almost everything compiled as a module by default in ubuntu?
yeah; mind you that's the case in modern Debian too,although we've added some more.is it in the mainstream kernel, or a third-party thing?
I think it's a third party at the moment
and is it one of the ones with binary-only firmware?
I think it's source, but I didn't look that closely:  http://aluminum.sourmilk.net/adm8211/


hi there.,so, has anyone tried to switch the runlevel? I've found unexpected behavior.
can't imagine anything being particularly unusual there, 2/3/4/5 should be the same ...
I'm using telinit 3 (I want to kill the Xserver so I can install the nvidia driver),however, the x server continues running, and the runlevel doesn't really change.
that sounds like you have expectations that come from Red Hat-derived distributions
ahh. Well, this may be the case. :)


what partition type would mount expect for a FAT32 usb pen?
vfat
I mean the partition type, in the mbr,you only get sda1 for a usb pen, because that's the first partition on the pen.  if there were no partitions, you would just get sda, but windows apparently doesn't like that,exactly, and you need an mbr to have a partition,I have the win32 codecs installed for wmv, which may or may not be necessary...
is there a package for them somehwere?
there are some rpms of it around, a big package called w32codecs, you can just unzip it though,or w32codec-all-20040706-0.pm.0.i386.zip maybe


i have a SD card from my camera that i want to mount at /media/camera instead of /media/sdc1.i tried a line in /etc/fstab but it stopped it from automounting - any ideas?,sudo schmudo - any ideas on my mount problem :),but then i will still have sdc1 show up in my /media dir
submit a bug report :)
but i don't think its a bug
you can use marillats packages
is marillats stuff better to install single packages or add to sources.list?


how do you search for packages with apt-get? like apt-get search mplayer or whatever,yes,so i can see what deps it will install.ok one last question :), how do i add universe to my apt-get list?
edit /etc/apt/sources.list,no, there's no mplayer package
even in universe?
i'd recommend installing totem-xine for more video support love
did that
not even in universe, no :)
having problems playing some wmv files
marillat's repo has some mplayer packages that will work, i hear,sounds like their next release will be 2.6
so what does ubuntu give me that debian doesn't?,i have a machine here that i'm thinking i'll put ubuntu on
gnome 2.8, 6-month release cycle, simplified install, Just Works(tm) technology
i run sid, tho..so all of the ubuntu patches will be merged with sid, right?.but ubuntu will be good for my non-development workstations, right?
we have little or no control over that; so far, some have been merged, and some have not
oh.  hrm.  i'll probably put ubuntu on my other box
and there is no patch for 6-monthly releases
heh.  yeah, that sucks.,there is a patch for 6-monthly releases.  it's called "34 paid employees" :)
aptitude remove <package>.how recent is your install?
i installed it this morning
from warty-release-install-i386.iso?
tried booting with 'custom'?
ah, no
installs the base system only, intended for clueful people to customize.does dpkg-depcheck help?
will try,thats much better, thank you.
I thought we already had 0.8,(as in, Monday)
hm it was .7 last i looked (ipw)
relatively recent change
neat.
chmod +x /home/brandon/bin/firefox-tabs
all my bin/ is +x
either that or the filesystem's mounted noexec
hm its on nfs, but it worked yesterday,noexec snuck in there somehow.. thanks
I tend to avoid noexec everywhere, since it doesn't really offer any benefit


okay, back from my first Ubuntu install,first comment: MY EYES!,No, mainly the default resolution,< 80hz and my eyes scream,This monitor really needs 1280x1024, not 1600,I believe not ;),Windows doesn't pick that resolution, neither does Fedora if I recall correctly,IMO, unless its the difference between 640x480 & 800x600 or 800x600 & 1024x768, refresh rate should trump all,san: I bet they are doing some checks to weigh in refresh rate over manufacturer recommendation,which certainly seems sane in this case
at one point the algorithm was basically "on CRTs, take the second-highest resolution offered",I think it might be more complicated than that now,the current artwork isn't final, you'll be glad to hear
yeah, I know. I don't mind it except for the color,but not your average user,Your average user has applications that crash because their Library/dot file/registry keys are wrong
they should report them as bugs :-)
which is all well and good, except for the fact they do
dotfile problems are a relatively rare cause for that in UNix
The right answer is to do both
disagree,in real life it is, though
and an iron will. ;)
heh.,i'm very interested what ubuntu is doing..would loading the acpi/apm moduels help by any chance?
what kind of machine?,pipka had the same problem
toshiba tecra 8100, p3-750, 128M.oh?  what's pipka using?,i think i may have to do FC2 for a few days.,but on sunday/monday, i can do a few more tests.
cool, thanks,i have to steal pipka's machine some time and have a poke, too,modprobe toshiba :)
did pipka try that?
it was already loaded, from what i remember
installation was a breeze, tho.  excellent work.  installed over wifi, too,i just checked my ubuntu install.  toshiba module was nowhere to be found (i did find . |grep -i tosh), and the same in dmesg returned nothing,too late :(,i have to get this running emacs in time for school in two hours.  it's got a clean harddrive :P.are you using emacs for gnome development?
no need, i don't embarrass anyone with my code. i just help the real coders. :-)
so i decided to just wait out the ubuntu installation,it's just completing now.  about an hour later.,so i reboot and modprobe toshiba, and it doesn't seem to get much quicker
i have a SD card from my camera that i want to mount at /media/camera instead of /media/sdc1.i tried a line in /etc/fstab but it stopped it from automounting - any ideas?,sudo schmudo - any ideas on my mount problem :),but then i will still have sdc1 show up in my /media dir,i dont mount my movie partition as hdc3 - i mount it as /media/movies,it would be nice to choose the name for my camera disk.where is the automount feature getting the path /media/sdc1 from?
the device name
so i cant change it then?
by running pmount yourself, yes, otherwise I think currently no,ok, so perhaps (warning: offhand idea at 3am) you can make udev cause the SD card to show up as /dev/camera rather than /dev/sdc1
checking udev config now -thanks,got it - if you're interested - i changed /etc/udev/udev.rules and added camera in there :)
right, no idea what the ramifications are but if it works for you then cool :),up to you,the installer only installs linux-386 because we only wanted one kernel on the CD
thanks :).I have an athlon XP 2500+, is the 686 the optimal package?
linux-k7, I suspect
so should i 'apt-get remove linux-686 && apt-get install linux-k7'?
not a big deal, if you want to,I wouldn't remove your running kernel if I were you, though,some, not massive,you can only chroot into something that looks a bit like a Linux system itself.,you can't chroot into any random directory (at least, not conveniently using chroot(1))
why do i get these messages during boot?,VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hda3.,VFS: Can't find ext2 filesystem on dev hda3.
that's probably just the kernel wandering through all the filesystems it knows about 'cos it hasn't been explicitly told what that filesystem is
fstab has it listed though,OOo 2 buuilds natively for amd64
yeah, I know,we were talking about it for warty, but it obviously wasn't going to be there in time, so we did the ia32-libs hack
good trade off
the other option was to leave it out, which wasn't really an option :),(for one, though it was hackable for CDs, it broke netboot installs for various reasons ...).did anyone answer your powerpc question?
no, i'm diving into the kernel source to see if i can fix it myself
fun,if that patch fixes it I imagine Herbert'll apply it
unfortunatly it looks like that patch has already been applied
yep, powernowd
`i'm wondering if it scaled my cpu really low cause it sat idle all weekend and then couldn't scale it back up
Ubuntu uses a derivative of the Debian kernel,while they aren't identical, saying "they have no relevance" is harsh and wrong.
exactly, it isn't stock, so you can't point to bugs and say for sure they exist in the ubuntu kernel,well check for yourself, there are no bugs in ubuntu referencing cdrecord
lack of bugs in Ubuntu Bugzilla does not imply lack of bugs in Ubuntu. :-),well, one of our staff is one of the main multiarch designers/developers, if that's what you mean
i guess that answers my question :) i'm currently using gentoo on my amd64 box because it had the best amd64 support around when i built it. i'd really like to switch to ubuntu though and multiarch support is really the only thing holding me back
dunno if we're doing multiarch for hoary though, it's a huge and complicated shift and will be easier if we're doing it in rough sync with Debian
Are installation reports wanted?  (My PowerPC install on a G4 went perfectly...)
might as well; with time we might be able to mine them for a hardware support database or something ...
okay....just use the d-i template?
it'll do as well as any, but make sure to send to ubuntu-users rather than debian-boot,yes, it is,in fact one of the recent Gnoppix CD images was exactly what we released as the Warty live CD
nice to see the collaboration
no, sorry
no problem, that's just what kept me out of trouble in debian unstable/experimental
it's called from hotplug
really?  I edited my iftab, and my devices are not getting renamed..can you take a loot at my interfaces and iftab file to see if you notice anything wrong?
sorry, in a meeting at the moment, I can only pay attention to IRC in spare moments
no problem.  Thanks.
yes, true,those two packages don't come from the same source package, so you shouldn't expect their versions to be in sync
that's what I was saying
the "2.6.10-1" part of the package name is the bit that states compatibility,what trey3 said was correct,then that's a bug, please report,and please state clearly what versions are involved, because there *was* an ABI problem with linux-image 2.6.10-5
what do you mean by *was*?  Was it fixed?
supposedly fixed in 2.6.10-5 ...
it just worked for bassinboy.  I couldn't get into X with 2.6.10-5 this morning, but it was updated again today I believe.  I'll reboot now and check.,maybe it was broken with 2.6.10-4, and the update I recall from today was 2.6.10-5,I've seen this twice now, where the DefaultDepth somehow gets set to "1" in their xorg.conf


hrmm apt-cache search mplayer worked but mplayer was not found, is there not a package for it?
have you installed the win32codecs?
hmm no /proc/config support?,or any other name
hopefully within a few months people will be content to let it be /dev/sda and let Rhythmbox come up with "4 GB iPod Mini"
nobody had my problem i guess?
If Sarge installer worked fine and Ubuntu failed, that sounds like a bug.
i have debian SID which works perfectly, maybe i will use that again then, i just was enthousiastic about ubuntu with gnome 2.8,i not freezed the computer, it just tries it forever, i waited an hour


a daily build should fix that, I think; I arranged for it to detect sata_nv properly
ok. Where can you get daily builds from?
I posted links to ubuntu-users last night,http://archive.ubuntulinux.org/cdimage/daily/current/, rsync access also available.with a daily build?
don't think it's daily,it's the default amd64 iso
fair enough; if you get a chance to give a current daily a try at some point to make sure it detects the disks properly (you don't have to do a full installation, just run up to partitioning), I'd appreciate it
I've tried that and have added root: foo@bar.com
may need to run 'newaliases'


will ubuntu include java environments like sun jdk oder blackdown java?
i don't think so, unless they are free
ocasionally, yes
have you tried to mount a sid pbuilder?
no, I used hoary's pbuilder


I've seen the missing picture pane in gthumb on FC2 as well,I have no idea how to get it back,gqview is an OK soluton
do you know if it has been reported as a bug?
no idea


will ubuntu include java environments like sun jdk oder blackdown java?
potentially later on, in restricted, but we want to be as fully free as possible,there's a longer answer to this in the FAQ
i think you refer to http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/helpcenterfaq.2004-09-16.3469703387. well, how can I check (beside installing ubuntu) whats ins restricted?
you can just look at the archive :-)
gna, i'm looking for something like http://packages.debian.org


ok
only for bugfixes before we release (but they're not high priority),then, on the development branch, they will be synced every day from sid,hrm, no; devel branch includes main and universe,no, ubuntu is based on sid
thx, ok
cool :-).do you know carlos perello marin?,sound-juicer! :)
yes but MP3 is diabled in my computer under SoundJuice
oh right
but i am hearing an mp3 cd with rythmbox right now,es,I thank for taht bug :D.Can I install mpg123?


o could anyone check for me wether there is an openvpn package?,I suppose there is,ok great, I prefer to keep 'within the system' as opposed to compiling a lot of seperate packages from source :).is there bootsplash support ?.the ubuntu 6 month release cycle, does it mean that the repository of packages is frozen and every 6 months new tested ones are added?
fairly soon we'll open up hoary, which will be a development repository until it freezes; you'll be able to track it while it's in development
but for instance if you have gaiml 1.0.0 in the repos and a month later they release 1.0.1, what happens? you need to wait another 5 months?
that'll go into the current development suite,it's in universe,not what you might call heavily tested, though; it only became installable a couple of days ago
well I just need a little something to burn dvdr, k3b did that fine before :)
supposed to be, I think there may still be a few bugs on some systems,we will be doing fora, yes,looks OK, provided your IP is 192.168.1.<something>; I would expect to see another line for the route to the gateway,yes,we'll be changing that soon, there's been enough feedback about it that it seems we have to bring back the keyboard configuration screen
that ash shell provided was also a bit weird, it reacts very strange to stuff like backspace
it's busybox, not ash
this is a bit specific but I use openvpn to provide me internet over the wireless network, could packages like openvpn be provided on the install disk?
the text is just a bit out of date, that's all,backspace has always worked for me ...,in general you need to file bugs about this kind of thing :)
could somebody explain how i get the oss compatibility drivers to load automatically in ubuntu?,i've tried putting lines in /etc/modutils/alsa-base but it does nothing
thry probably are, does you volume control not show two sets of mixers?
there's no /dev/dsp, which is the problem,snd-pcm-oss,is not loaded
does modprobe snd_pcm_oss produce errors?
no,and everything works fine after i do that....i just need to get that module loaded automatically
ok, quick fix is to add it /etc/modules then, just add that name on a line of the file by itself
there is a line in /usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian that tells me a about it,but i did what it says, and that didn't help,i did that,i put it in /etc/modutils/alsa-base,and ran update-modules.in /etc/hotplug/blacklist?
someone will try
so, does ubuntu use /etc/modprobe at all?  from the documentation it sounds like there was a switch from /etc/modules.conf to it in the 2.6 version of module-init-tools, but the file is empty,/etc/init.d/gdm restart,or stop :)
froma console, sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
what is the advantage of using invoke-rc.d over just typing in the path to the script?
I have no idea, but debian told me to...
is the installer able to reparttion a dsk without destroying existing data?
yes, but no responsibility for accidental data loss etc. ... backups are your responsibility :),press Enter on the partition you want to resize, press Enter on the size row, enter new size,if that doesn't work, it's a bug (and there are a few known bugs here).this is with the warty preview release CD, right?.which filesystem are you trying to resize?,OK, I'll have another look,no, if anything that should make bugs like that less likely to occur,it works for me just now, too.just triple-checking, from what URL did you download the image?
from the Ubuntu site,I was skipping around in the partitioning menus quite a bit
I'm trying to make sure that you didn't download from /cdimage/sounder-test/current/, which is where the installation howtos mistakenly pointed at one point,use rsync rather than redownloading
did a bug report on the partitioning resize thing
ta,if you haven't already included /var/log/partman from the installer, I'd appreciate a copy of that
will do, as soon as I figure out how to extricate it,saw the edit on the bug - methinks perhaps that screen could be formulated slightly clearer
so if you say yes to that dialog, does it then offer you the size?
yes,it feels it really should be asking me for a size first, though
I think it might be because it doesn't know how to calculate the maximum size before you've written the changes to disk.how about if the screen were just clarified a bit?
yes, make it clearer at least
something along those lines, yeah
congratulations, the resize bug is real after all
hmm?
partitioner refuses to resize
won't help,section, normally,there's a tool called 'orphaner' to do interactive removals, too
anyone get ndiswrapper working on ubuntu?
i did this afternoon,what's your problem with ndiswrapper,you have to install kernel-headers also
it sounds like the oss drivers are getting loading before the alsa ones,well i ran through the steps in the mailing list to setup ndiswrapper


does universe just contain additional packages, or newer versions of ones in main/restricted?,ah ok
warty/main has 2146 binary packages (i386), universe has the 10995 others,and if you can't find the build log there, pester me and I'll kick it again...,need jdk, and there isn't one.
so is there a way around it? cuz i am assuming that there isnt going to be a jdk package anytime soon
dunno, short of maybe build from source...
hmm ok...and installing the debian packages will probably cause me more headache than building them?
depends on how techincal you want to be...
u around?


Ok - I'm curious exactly how I would upgrade from woody....I'm assuming I change my sources.list and then do a dist-upgrade, but what do I add in?,or...replace rather.
http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/Archive,additional
I have another question..  how do I log in as root through the terminal?  I need to be root to install the Nvidia drivers,sorry, i've never used a Debian distro before
As I remember from Universe you can install nvidia drivers,but I am not completely sure, alot of install since yesterday night
yeah, I just installed this last night..  the only other distro I have used is Cobind Linux
I have used Suse, RH and some Debian, and I will stick to Ubuntu, I really like it
I have another question..  how do I log in as root through the terminal?  I need to be root to install the Nvidia drivers,sorry, i've never used a Debian distro before
"sudo <cmd>, you ll be ask for a password, put youjr user's pass and you re done
ok, thanks guys,I'll try it out.also, once I have exited X, how do I restart it?,yeah, I just installed this last night..  the only other distro I have used is Cobind Linux,I'll try and install drivers right now


I have another question..  how do I log in as root through the terminal?  I need to be root to install the Nvidia drivers,sorry, i've never used a Debian distro before
the root account it disabled, you either use sudo before every command, or run sudo bash for a root prompt,the nvidia driver is in apt archive
how do I search in apt-get??  I can't find the command
run the synaptic package manager
I'm in the synaptic package manager, and I've found several nvidia entries.should I get nvidia-glx?,I alrady have restricted-modules installed.after installing nvidia-glx, do I have to make changes to etc/X11?
do you want to be able to use rhythmbox?,/mnt isn't the "correct" place to do that sort of thing, I don't know whether you care about that...
where should I mount my windows partition then?,ok, that's just how I've always mounted my windows partition under Cobind Linux


i am getting loads of /dev/mixer - no such file or directory" errors when trying to run mplayer - any ideas?,eg. - ALSA lib control.c:654:(snd_ctl_open_noupdate) Invalid CTL /dev/mixer0 16%,alsa-control: mixer attach /dev/mixer error: No such file or directory
do you have alsa's oss emulation modules loaded? (snd-pcm-oss, which will also load snd-mixer-oss),multiverse includes non-free and contrib components,additionally, it merges external sources
if i enable multiverse - does that cover all of universe too then?
no, you need to enable multiverse _and_ universe.
is that wise?
depends on what _you_ want
mplayer :)
you can use marillat's repo for it.
and tuxpaint :P.and the codecs like xvid, divx?
tuxpaint is in 'universe',codecs are in marillat's repo.
as i said i have dist-upgraded to current sid
erm, why are you asking here if you've upgraded to sid?
For ripping in mp3 and ogg, do you recomend GRIP or o you know of a better app?
if it does what you want, soundjuicer is just about as easy to use as it could be
you need to add the universe repository to sources.list
what is universe repository?
does debian not have an /etc/rc.d/rc.local anymore?,or is that ubuntu specific
debian doesn't have /etc/rc.d/ at all
I operate a mail cluster of 13 servers,why would I want a gmail account ? :P,in case anyone was wondering,#debian is populated by wankers :/
thats not the ubuntu spirit :(
take as much as you can get of random stuff here and there


hmm, damn, no partition splitter on ubuntu..,:)
package name?
hmm, like qsplitter or something?,ah..
found something?
I think I will just use partition magic in windows, to split a partition, then install linux.
there are some known issues, but having wireless work is pretty high on the list for us...
well, to your credit, only distro that allowed my generic proxim2_usb card to function was Linspire 4.5 after I compiled the latest proxim package..
not really sure what our current status is, but then, I'm about to face-plant into the keyboard...,gotta sleep.
a flash stick with a ready-to-boot distro would be a little sweet actually,plug in to any machine - x86 or PPC - and run,rather, a "LiveCD", but flash, ,where real system config changes are backed up on the flash device,but transient stuff are ram only
morphix can already do all that,anssuming the USB boot works right
so, once you boot the flash device, settings of your mail accounts and so on will be updated on the device
that could be a 5 minute project almost
more like a user-updateable lieCD,Bluecurve is pretty good
there is a Ubuntu liveCD around right?.made by alex?
sed -e 's/nv/nvidia/' -i /etc/X11/XF86Config-4,modprobe nvidia
nice :).what does the -i do?
in-place editing.,as opposed to just spitting the file out to stdout
know anything about wireless :)
heh..what's your issue?
i just cant get ndiswrapper to work correctly
well, I'm useless for that,np,:).how did you do it?.probably. why?
got it :).you used it before?
is onboard on a dell D600,yeah lsmod shows a bunch of snd_intel8x0m and snd_intel8x0,rhythmbox gives me /dev/dsp donent exist,doesn't*,i thought my wireless was my only problem..doh :0,yes...and its my bosses laptop :(,indeed,linux-source-2.6.8.xxx ,and apt-get install gcc,me either...still trying to get ndiswrapper working
cat /proc/version says I got 2.6.8.1-2-386. I am able to find 2.6.8.1 in kernel.org but not xxx-2 :-?
if u use synaptic and search for linux-source you will find the ubuntu source
well, I kinda need the wireless connection working to apt-get anything ::,get a syntax usb card from ecost...ah.. ndiswrapper.. why not get a hardware with opensource driver?,just get a cheap USB wireless card..
yeah true


I'm getting errors while trying to apt-get upgrade with hal and j2re1.4,update-alternatives: unable to make /usr/lib/mozilla-cvs/plugins/javaplugin_oji. so.dpkg-tmp a symlink to /etc/alternatives/javaplugin_oji-mozilla-cvs.so: No suc h file or directory,n does not exist             [fail] ,run-parts: /etc/dbus-1/event.d/hal exited with return code 1,invoke-rc.d: initscript dbus-1, action "restart" failed.,dpkg: error processing hal (--configure):, subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1,Setting up j2re1.4 (1.4.0.99beta-1) ...,sorry for the flood that was the hal error
<toothpick> n does not exist             [fail]   .what's the line before ?
Jay perhaps that is why.,one sec, * Starting Hardware Abstraction Layer..., *:22:54.692 [E]  hald.c:268: drop_privileges: group haldaemon does not exist             [fail] 
that's a fresh ubuntu installation ?
well I added sid sources and did apt-get upgrade,for example crafty wasn't available via the sources provided so I just added sid's from debian.
yes, but we made changes to hal,the debian version is not compatible
ok


i got a gmail account bec. I barely need it.,I mean 200MB from yahoo mail is more than enough..,Yahoo mail + yahoo pop! = heaven,well, having a search function is quite useful, even in Yahoo..,hmm, the closed source driver seemed to install pretty easily on Debian woody (but that was like a year ago).,if you download the drivers, it should come with documentations..do you guys keep a note for all these cli stuff?.matt, why weren't you happy with gentoo?
no, I just keep it in my head.
hmm, you must have good memory..,yes :-D
dude, I'm the only one in here who knew what sed was.
I agree.
once you get used to the CLI you don't want to go back to GUIs for things that require actual thought,dude, that's what Ubuntu is all about. :)
really?
um, if you want ntfs *access* it's a few seconds,If you want ntfs write, it's a pain in the ass as always.,.us for me,The company is 'Canonical',dude, I've seen these guys.,trust me, you don't want pics.,heh. No, they're all starving to death, but somehow they have internet access and computers.
hi,still awake :)
dude, I don't sleep.
so you want someone to come to your place to give you a reason to go? ;),hi.i noticed you are on the placestostay list but aren't going yourself?
well, if somebody comes to my place, then I'll be going,If nobody wants to, then I'm not :),I didn't say that. :)
what is the proper way to upgrade fc3 since up2date doesn't work right? yum or something like that?
yeah. yum update.,but you should really be using ubuntu anyway. Yum sucks.
hmm maybe i'll stick with ubuntu then :),after reading the rpm guide rpm doesn't seem so bad, just different vs deb ;)
meh. it's not that RPM as a package format is bad, it's just that it seems like most of the packages suck.
yea,hehe, yea :),colin "stifler" walters? ;),heh he seemed to always be quiet when he was a DD ;)
I think we're bringing him out of his shell.
internal redhat irc channel?
heh. yeah.,yep.
any ideas?,wrt how to get sleep to work on laptops.infiltrating redhat with ubuntu cd's?
:)
daniels installed that way i think


I actually have my own server, but I like the GMail UI
give it away on http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php
has anyone done anything about getting the KDE libs in Ubuntu using the GNOME theme ?
not that I know of...full kde support is not on the drawing board, so I'm not sure how much work anyone is going to put into the theme matching
poke smot
I think it's actually a pc104 keyboard in the later models, what language/country is the keyboard for?
you think it might be the keyboard?
well, if the keyboard was working during the setup, the keyboard has been proved to work in some respects,the installer would have been on the console, are you able to press Ctrl-Alt-F1   (Use Ctrl-Alt-F7 to get back)  and see if the keyboard works there
same as with windows,then wireless and sound Just Work,if you want write access to NTFS, complain to MS, it's their fault it doesn't exist in Linux
well, it *does* exist,it's just that you need to load an ntfs.sys driver from a Windows system.
using a horrific hack
horrific or not, the hack works *really* well.
toolchain not package system
heh.,dude, there is no cabal.
haha
I'm just kidding. :).Aren't you Sideshow?
allegedly
heh, rock.
have I met you and forgotten already?
heh, no. daniels was ranting about how insane it was that you ARE sideshow bob.,daniels crashed at my place and we went to OLS, then he flew up to your meetup
ahhhhhh, now I remember,one day I'll find a working nuke :-/
heh.
hah
did you hear the word? I spread about 30 Ubuntu CDs to my Red Hat peers.
hah, awesome.  any word back yet?
not yet. initial impressions of the packaging were very positive though.
careful you don't get in trouble ;-)
heh, are you kidding me? dude, you guys are on Product Management's radar now ;)
haha
I'm serious, btw. Donald Fischer, one of the guys in PM, actually has both a copy of your x86 Warty CD set and the PPC install disc
woah, wow.do you think we're seen as up against fedora or rhel or both?
right now? not sure. I'm willing to bet that I'll be called in on a meeting about it if it's deemed a threat to RHEL.,I personally see you guys as the RHEL to Debian's Fedora
hmmmm, very interesting
yeah, well, we'll see how it goes :),I handed them out yesterday, so maybe I'll have some feedback on Monday,of course, I'm sure you can't really say in detail, but would you agree more with my assessment? or would you say otherwise? re the RHEL/Fedora outlook.
ah, right,hm...ubuntu is going hard on the community side of things, too, to create a strong community as well.  but at the moment, debian is very much our backbone.
well, the thing is, Fedora is going that way. the problem really is that it was announced and forced out prematurely; the infrastructure for it being a community project was never in place,but there's a CVS server which (if it hasn't been announced yet) is going to be made public soon
ah, that is a good start,there seems to have been a fair bit of disappointment with how fedora's community aspect has been delt with so far
seriously. and there have been plenty of flames directed at Gafton as far as the Fedora thing goes. But Fedora right now, at least within Red Hat, is mostly a one-man show. So it's amazing (to me anyway) just how far it's already come
hrm, I didn't realise it was like that, it seemed it was intended as a major corporate thrust
heh. the rest of the company tends to take a while to catch up to the PR department.,those guys have big mouths. :/
hah, right,that lack is one of our advantages for now then ;-),haha
so, yeah, tonight has been fun
I'm still waiting for daniels to get @gnome.org on his key
dude, I want to beat him to it,because he's also got an @kde.org and an @fd.o
once he is part of those 3 pillars of the FS movement, it's all over


no, I'm talking about the toolchain,you do what you want for the distro,but you want a biarch compiler,and building a ppc64 kernel will soon require a biarch gcc anyway,well, one thing is that on ppc64, it's usually accepted that biarch distro is also the way to go,nobody wants a ppc64 bash,64 bits binaries are bigger & slower, thanks to our fucked up ABI,that's what all distros do at least,Canberra, .au,Canonical is an .au company ? :)
isle of man.
where is that ? :)
just off the coast of Scotland
oh, good scotch over there !
you should jump on ubuntu-devel and tell everyone :-).do we need glibc cvs for this to work?
there is nothing but glibc cvs nowadays
does sound work on the current crop of g5 imacs?
nope,on my todolist,it's a different codec chip
ah
I have the specs tho
oh, yay apple
well, they change the sound hw in +/- subtle ways on pretty much every motherboard revision,which is why sound is one of the weak points of linux on mac, keep breaking
ahhh
I need to rewrite the driver in a more "modular" way so we can more easily add codec drivers
does OS X also need continual updates then?
and so it can deal with multiple codecs (digital + analog on the same bus),didn't have time yet... I could use help from more hackers tho =P,yes, apple ships modified OS X with pretty much every new model,though they include the updates with the next release,same used to be with OS 9... if a machine shipped with, let's say, 9.1, it wouldn't necessarily work (or not everything would work) with a stock 9.1,but only with the "modified" 9.1 that comes with it ... However, 9.1.1 or whatever >9.1 would work
hah, hard to test drivers for hardware I don't have ;),ahhh, I see
heh,what is needed is first some background work on the driver
can you pretend g5 imac work is ibm work by claiming it's nearly a power4? ;)
defining a simple infrastructure to split the platform core (that puts all the bits & pieces together for a given machine), the codec modules, the bus driver & DMA engine, ...,pretty much defining structs and moving existing code in new structure,that can be done with any Apple HW,from then, writing the codec modules for the other machines and the platform bits is easy,there are some pitfalls though due to the way apple crapped out some stuff, like the GPIO control, but it's not _too_ bad,heh, I already do a lot of work on these on IBM time :),it's more a matter of not impairing more urgent IBM work which I do have right now, though the thermal control was done partly here,after all, the iMac G5 I use is IBM's :)
hah, cool.are sound devices in modern apples on the pci bus?
not  exactly,apple has a big IO chip on the PCI bus (they always had) that contains all sorts of stuffs,some of these appear as individual PCI devices though (like the USB controllers), but a bunch of stuff is all in the same "combo" PCI device,you can "see" the details abotu what's in there from the OF device-tree though,it contains, among others, a pair of i2s bus controllers (a sound bus, in a way similar to ac97),and i2c controller,that's how codec chips are typically attached


whoa, benh, dude! :)
hm, would it be worth bugging a aarnet guy about an ubuntu mirror?
possibly,we'll have one at pacific and optus soon
oh, pimp
powernowd
ok to add a link from the faq to the "benfits" section of the wiki?
sure,we should probably shift that all to the website or something though
hm, that sounds more like a non-bob2 job
and non-jdub job ;),yeah, but recent work requires inotify, dbus cvs, etc.,nah, it includes a unified search tool ui
when will nautilus get ifolder love?
dunno,he may have felt like an idiot :)
heh,dnotify? ;)
via fam, yeah,naw, just needs xcomposite. xcompmgr is the standalone composite manager :)
ah
i always say good morning,(ubuntuforums can do that too),(and is nicer to use for forum people)
but it leads to crap like ::smile:: in emails
that could probably be fixed
and quoting to make your eyes bleed
yeah
getting "error 21", which sounds like (from google) "your bios doesn't know about that disk"
... does your bios know about that disk? :)
no, it's on a pci ide thing,oh, I guess grub uses the bios to see disks
your mum?
'deb http://people.no-name-yet.com/~jdub/warty ./' works, right?
think so
the problem is your i386-fascism
ah.,bah, that's what i was thinking fo ;),i told Greves not to
"someone" (in the hyatia sense) should package the FAQ
that's not a problem for us,our installer doesn't fit on a floppy already
I think colin wanted to make hoary be installable from floppies,tho I guess that could be text-only
reasonably likely that we'll be using python to do the graphical installer right anyway,yeah, there'll always be the fallback
oh, ok
hibernate is the right word for it
hrm, ok
suspend-to-disk is a silly technical word :)
hah,sleep and suspend seem to mean both mean str or std depending on who you talk to
seriously. hibernate (suspend to disk) and sleep (to ram) are great words
I shall remember that,apparently X has gotten slow for a few people
yes,doesn't matter for gcc :-)
it does if you want to use any C++ libraries
its all installed etc,thanks clee,no i just have to figure out sound :(,now*
what sort of problems are you having with sound?,someone has it working on a d600. i'm waiting for his response (he may be asleep),remove the snd-intel8x0m.ko file (rm -f) and the i810_audio.ko
well removing those files didnt seem to help
did you remove ac97_codec.ko, too?
its there
are you rebooting between changes?,ok, use #flood to paste me the ALSA-related lines from ``dmesg'',could you paste the output of ``lsmod'' on pastebin.com.and this is with 2.8.6.1-2?.ok, and if you juggle the irqs (i.e. disable the devices in bios you don't use), what occurs?,:),well, you can do anything....what "what" is set to?,hmm, i was actually thinking about muine, which uses libxine by default (~/.gnome2/muine/xine-config),i suppose rhythmbox uses gstreamer by default,run gstreamer-properties and look at the setting for output sink,yup, 5 minutes ago.what's up?,that's resolved
134 packages updated, smooth as silk
as long as it has 32 MB RAM or more, it's fine,xfce4 should run decently,4.0.5-1 is in universe
have u tried it on a 166 with 32mb ram?
just not use it.
k thanks,i am stuck in a "Entering low memory mode" loop
alt+F2, fdisk and create a swap partition manually, mkswap, then swapon,you have to create the swap partition and mount it as early as possible,timing issue,you _must_ cfdisk _as soon_ as the part* udebs have been loaded
what level is that book at?
beginning python, covers OOP basics, too,in the ora tradition, there are also Programming - & and - Cookbook titles, too
ooo cookbook my come in handy.you read Dive into Python?,i have libxml2-dev
and libxml++2.6-dev?
well i can find a tar.gz of it but not a deb anywhere
you need the linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` package
do you know the stats on openoffice beta/2.0 for 64bit in ubuntu?
I'm afraid I don't, sorry
is there something being added to hoary before the release for that?
no,pong
i just noticed that sudo touch afile makes the owner root and the group staff...is the staff part something new to hoary?,well i did a sudo touch in the home dir and it made it root:staff,but if i do a sudo touch in my own home dir then it makes it root:root
that makes sense:,ls -l /,-y,to apt-get,otherwise, just echo y to the process,because the syntax is wrong,echo "$foo" | sudo adduser,but keep in mind you'll want to pass flags to adduser, not just use it by itself,the man page will help you with that,else it will hang asking you for last name, first name, ...
and that will work for multiple questions, as it asks, for name, password (twice) etc
the man page explains all
4.1 preview looks very nice  :),Good work everyone involved so far... just installed it today... Fedora and Debian background  :)
I concur :) very nice.
middle mouse button twice will open new window, and close parent...
perfect, thanks. That works, i know there is a pref somewhere too but thats perfec :)
sometimes its handy to keep parent open though...


partition magic is neat for some things but it's really crappy at others,for example, the parted stuff with ntfs resizing is a few hundred times faster than partition magic's ntfs resize ops,parted is totally insane,but its pretty solid if you can stand the shitty text UI
eh? parted has a great text ui
no. it's evil.


and then look which dev=ATA:... string is for you
shrug, ide-cd makes /dev/hdc work with 2.6  :/
but not blessed by usptream, export trouble, sooner or later
its what I used... and I'm running Ubuntu having burned it using cdrecord  :/,no, you use ide-cd
it works now but JS is an ashole. He can disable this access method in the next reason just for fun.,what "no"? I mean ide-cd.


you around?,do you know how to get the trashbin back on the desktop
not sure, sorry
is this what i need to get transparencies etc working: deb http://people.ubuntu.com/~daniels/ xcompmgr/
yeah, then run xcompmgr
its not brutal..but its noticably slower.any word on transset?
yeah give me a bit, in the middle of fixing the bugs reported today
no worries, just curious
i'll send the xorg package around for another build, then I'll get to transset and stuff while that's building
is there a reason that only part of transset is available?


i c.. fabbione, i just checked the wiki, but not much right now. ,nope.. haven't thought of that...can I search through the mailing list?,'k will check it right now..
what kind of wifi hardware do you have?
I got Syntax Wireless USb, which I got for free afer rebate from Ecost..
we do :),we're all here,sydney, australia,in the channel between uk and france,great for parties.,none of the developers actually live on the island ;),we're all over the world
i am not sure. but we will have X.org for hoary (6 months) and preview packages are expected no later than mid december,we need to finalize Xfree86 for warty before starting on X.org. too much mess otherwise
yeah, fair enough
"click next -> next -> next -> done",there is a bug in -17 postinst script
ah.daniels how does one get the X probe magic to run again?.do you have any newer sparc boot images than the ones on sparc.u.c?
not yet
is that a gcc or silo bug?
dunno. could be even an OBP problem that doesn't understand gcc3.3 generated code properly,he is not using an ubuntu version of xmms
hm? dpkg think it's sinstalled.
^^
oh, duh me, good point
shhh!,it's not the lastest git snapshot...


But yeah... Ubuntu just got a trial on my desktop... a keeper for a while  :),Just would like to see the boot process and perhaps the installer tweaked a little... made more pretty if this is to be a desktop distro...,Already perhaps the most intuitive I have seen though... 
I seem to remember a graphical installer was mentioned somewhere, but I may have imagined it
would be nice... debian-installer can be configured to use a GUI instead of ncurses, also something to cover up GRUB wouldn't be too bad... just a few logo's ala rhgb...
http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/HoaryHedgehog, second item
upgrades easy through releases just like Debian right?
it should, have to wait until one happens to find out of course :)
kinda what I figured  :),resembles closely what I was looking for with a Debian... if they do it right  :)


ahhh.. sorry guys, got another question. Should be easy..,ok so I want to mount my winblows partition (so I can keep music accessible in one place)..,I've got everything set up in fstab, except I'm not sure which options to pass,the filesystem is ntfs,Ok no, not readonly though
then you have to use a horrific hack that loads a windows driver into the linux kernel,run aptitude or synaptic,to apt? yes.,lame is the best I know of, I did, but I got rid of it since I never used it,no, it's not in ubuntu, since the people who claim to hold patents on mp3 encoding are not very friendly,vorbis almost always beats mp3 for quality at the same bitrate,prefix my name,like this
like this?,You're my hero, I'm such an irc noob,btw I was aware of ogg's better overall sound at the same size.. it's just too bad I can't change the quality. 
eh? of course you can.
apparently not through sound-juicer,which is what rhythmbox uses


what is the progress on wireless networking?
sorry but i am not working on wireless. afaik there is a page on the wiki to track it,i don't use wireless myself ;)
i c.. fabbione, i just checked the wiki, but not much right now. 
did you check the mailing list?,there is some discussion going on
nope.. haven't thought of that...can I search through the mailing list?
about firmwares and stuff like that,i believe so
anyone else run into problems with gstreamer audio playback problems? I'm getting "OSS device "/dev/dsp" is already in use by another program." when I try to play music in Rhythmbox.
run "gstreamer-propertie" and select the esd output sink
hi !.I'm wondering if there are any plans to go to some decent glibc version ?,unlike debian which is stuck with a years old one, doesn't do NTPL/TLS on ppc and is hopeless for ppc64,hehe,getting a glibc that doesn't suck is a big pain with debian atm,ok, I'll try to keep an eye on it
we have a few of those to build on, unfortunately haven't got smp going,not for WartyWarthog, but for our next release... a few people have asked about it
interesting,when does the next release cycle open so I jump in ? :)
within the month, i'm sure.did you see our patch for booting on G5 xserve?
which one ? :),G5s really _WANT_ a 64 bits kernel btw,oh, I have fixed 32 bits boot in latest bk I think,you should build biarch toolchains & build 64 bits kernels
we're considering multiarch, given amd64 and ppc64 support
patch looks good, basically what i commited upstream.SMP doesn't work with that ?
colin and thom were very excitedly setting them up when we got them ;)
well, I admit I haven't tried a 32 bits kernel on a g5 for ages
don't believe so, thom and colin will know more,nah, but 6/34 are aussie
I still think biarch should be considered for ppc64 ... oh well...
hey, could happen :)
there will be binary apps that will be 32 bits,that is the main problem,like IBM own management tools
yeah
during "copying remaining packages to hard disk" my system stops at 27%, I tried another burn and another iso and still get the same thing, andy ideas?
check the md5sum of the .iso file and the cd,if some device isn't automounting, please file a bug
I think its because its NTFS,snackalot is out of hand :),:)
er, attitude please
stated a fact, judgement please
er, no, sorry,configure it to not ask for the cd
fabbione or does the transparency stuff need a new xlibs?
libs-wise, you just need a new render/xrender, fixesext/xfixes, damageext/xdamage, and compositeext/xcomposite
ah
could be either.it does now. his install is out of date, remember?,one of my friends is saying 'rad'
^ swcursor
the apostrophe ate your e, by the looks
cef_work btw, did that guy with the the little embedded machines organise a group order?
i dunno,it's called an x40
bah
yeah, I have 8859-1, which rhythmbox and my iRiver happily deal with
ah
... lithuania, brazil ...,that rhymes with claverly
and just like the claverley, I'd have bitched a lot less if I'd GOT SOME FREAKIN' MUFFINS
except you did get muffins
but they cost me my soul
you sold your soul long ago
I made a deal with an archangel,it was a car, not a card
er, yeah,if you can walk him through nuking HorizSync/VertRefresh, I'll buy you a drink at Fabric

i had it on my hp
that old?
pii 650,(but it was originally a 350 or 450),yes, but none of the drivers are,which is as good as the same thing
ah
around the world,no, these are the random 'oh, hey, video bios, let's change random crap and hope it's right' tools
haha
it'll get merged as a duplicate of the terrible vbe implementation thing
how does windows handle all those broken vbe things? special-case-o-matic?
not much point, need to write out a custom chipid, and xserver-xfree86 in warty isn't seeing any updates, modulo security,yeah dude, days come 48x more rapidly in ubuntu land
sleeeeeeeeeep
no, kernel update; i assume he modified /boot/grub/menu.lst without paying attention to the comments that said 'do this if you want your changes to be preserved'
like kde!.radeon x600 should Just Work, right?
in theory, yes.  in pracrice, it tends to lock up, apparently, but I haven't got any hardware. :\,he's talking about when using the automake wrapper with multiple versions installed
is there any terrible hack to capture xvideo areas in a screenshot?
hmm, it should work,hm no, turns up as colourkey,not that I'm aware of, sorry
while we're kind of on topic, is there any way to get dvds playing without compiling from source?,(I poked around universe and didn't see any libdvdnav/dvdplay etc that looked like it would play encrypted dvds)
unfortunately, DVD and such have patent problems,somebody has posted a link on the ubuntu-user list with APT lines to various 'interesting' stuff that Ubuntu can't ship otherwise
how do I change resolution and refresh rate globally? currently,                I have to change it every time I log in, and changing it also,                doesn't apply to the login screen,oops, sorry about the mess :/
you can change /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 manually, or run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
there is no refresh rate setting in XF86Config-4
refresh rate is in the monitor section, X should work out what to use within a range.what error?
all it said was "fail" instead of "ok"


ubuntu supports opteron, yes?.the i386 iso won't work on opteron then?
it will, but it would be stupid,http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=MultipleCards,pay attention to the .asoundrc part, in that file, you set the defaults for alsa,its all in the alsa wiki...shocking i know
Hmm,I'll try it
i'd recommend not using esd,alsa by itself works much better for me and everyone else i know.maybe tell esd which alsa card to use?
hmmmm,yeah, there is a config file.  I bet if I passed it /dev/mixer1 as the mixer, it would do what I want.oh?.using the usual hack of just moving the device files around, or do I have to do something m
